Got one as an Xmas gift. I use it primarily for pre workout. The carabiner broke within days but I expected that. Found and older key ring I wasn’t using and hooked a new biner on it. Simple and effective. Personally it’s 5 stars for me but I know people don’t want to have to upgrade something they’ve spent money on. I’ll be ordering more for gifts for my friends. If they was more of a variety of the labels or a whey (haha) to customize them that would be a huge plus up for me. All in all a good product.

I like the hydrolized whey it's easier on our stomachs.... Since I have a bottle of dymatize iso100 peanut butter hydrolized whey, and I make a shake for me and the wife, I use one scoop of the iso100 and 1 pack of this myoplex, with the same ingredients listed above, man it's soo good....

I don't know exactly what people expect to get out a review for a protein shake?  It makes me feel better after drinking it, but that could be psychosomatic.  It costs a bunch, but it comes in nice packets, which specify servings and nutrition information.  You could probably achieve the same thing with one of those big buckets of questionable off-white powder, but then you don't get the impressive packaging and presentations.  I mean, if the things is psychosomatic, then every little bit helps.   Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2008         None\n",

I don't know exactly what people expect to get out a review for a protein shake?  It makes me feel better after drinking it, but that could be psychosomatic.  It costs a bunch, but it comes in nice packets, which specify servings and nutrition information.  You could probably achieve the same thing with one of those big buckets of questionable off-white powder, but then you don't get the impressive packaging and presentations.  I mean, if the things is psychosomatic, then every little bit helps.   Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2008         None\n",

Just a word of warning...I did a search on the web and found a 2012 lab study from Consumer Reports that compared 15 popular protein drinks for heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury. Fortunately EAS Myoplex didn't have any lead or mercury, but in 3 scoop-servings of EAS they did find 16.9 micrograms of Arsenic and 5.1 micrograms of cadmium - each of those exceeding FDA guidelines at the time.

Just a word of warning...I did a search on the web and found a 2012 lab study from Consumer Reports that compared 15 popular protein drinks for heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury. Fortunately EAS Myoplex didn't have any lead or mercury, but in 3 scoop-servings of EAS they did find 16.9 micrograms of Arsenic and 5.1 micrograms of cadmium - each of those exceeding FDA guidelines at the time.

I started a weight loss journey earlier this summer. I had some left over from my heavy weightlifting days and used my last packet of strawberry. They aren't EXACTLY like a milk shake, but they are as close as you can get without all the extra calories and fat. Put it in a blender with a little milk, water and ice and it's an awesome treat. It's so thick you can stand a spoon up in it. Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2018         None\n",

I bought a pack of the Strawberry and Cream, and the texture was terrible.  I have to choke down every sip.  The strawberry bits have the consistency of unmixed protein powder.  If you enjoy a partially mixed protein shake, then you'll love the strawberry and cream flavor, but I doubt anyone enjoys chunks in their protein shakes.  Also, the taste is very difficult to take.  I don't usually whine about the taste of protein shakes and bars.  I see eating/drinking these as a necessary evil, but the Myoplex Strawberry Cream really challenges my taste buds to finish the shake.
