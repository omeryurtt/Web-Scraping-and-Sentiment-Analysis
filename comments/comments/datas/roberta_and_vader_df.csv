I feel great!,"After having tremendous problems with immune system issues, particularly in the gut with IBS, I had a doctor that thought I had gluten issues. I was tested for this during upper GI endoscopy and the test showed negative. The only thing I know for certain is that I cannot digest meat very well. I am not a vegan, but my body has moved me more and more in that direction because I cannot digest meat without massive stomach issues and I felt hungry and tired all the time. On the quest for a protein supplement that doesn't come from animals, I discovered this product.First and foremost, this is not the best tasting thing you ever tried, but the taste will grow on you. Make sure you are mixing it properly and with COLD water. I have the 
  
Cuisinart CSB-76BC SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blender, Brushed Chrome







  
  
     and this is what I use to mix mine. It's so easy! I add about 8 oz water, instead of the recommended 6 oz and this gives me a better blend.  By the way, while people are going on and on about how bad this is. It is not that bad. As I said, the taste will grow on you, but if you're not mixing it fully, it can be quite chalky. BTW, I use the chocolate flavor and if you're mixing right, it DOES taste like a chocolate shake. In the beginning, I didn't mix mine well using a standard blender and it tastes bad if you don't get it fully mixed. I switched to the hand blender, which does a marvelous job and so much easier to clean up afterward.All of that aside, the real question is, does it work? Do you have more protein? Do you feel differently while taking this supplement. The answer to all of those for me is absolutely YES! Not only do I feel more energized (I have two shakes a day now), my IBS is practically a thing of the past. The great thing about this product is that it contains probiotics and these are different than the usual kind you see in pill form. I never noticed any difference with the probiotic pills, but with this, I am more ""normal"" than I've ever been. Perhaps it's the combination of the raw protein and the probiotics and the amino acids? I have no idea, but it's rare I can say this: It has changed my life!I have never felt this good in my life, no really, never. I noticed it just after two days of use, so I discontinued using it to see if it was just placebo effect. Within 3 days, all my old gut issues came back, so I went back on this supplement and now I'm never going off. Even my mood is so much better and when people notice and say how happy you seem and what are you doing different - then you know you're onto something. It's amazing how much happier I am when I'm not malnourished and sick to my stomach all the time. I never thought I would feel well enough again to live life fully, but I am now. I have been telling everyone that if people knew how much better this stuff could make them feel, they couldn't keep it on the store shelves. Maybe I was just that bad off, but I can't believe this powder has made all that difference, but it has. Even my seasonal allergies have improved since taking this product. What in the world is in this stuff? I don't know, but I hope they never stop making it. I'm on the subscription plan now. I call this my prescription because it works better than all the stomach pills the doctors had me on and this has given me no side effects.If you are having digestion issues, please give this a try. You might be as lucky as me and see a huge difference in the way you feel. I feel awful for people that are suffering, like I was. This might do the trick for you, too.",Flavor Name: Chocolate,the United States,2013-03-21

Krishnaswami,4.0,"Neutral taste, good source of vegan non-soy protein at a reasonable price","If you're looking for a non-GMO, non-heated, natural source of protein that doesn't break the bank, this one fits the bill. And Amazon has the best price (especially if you subscribe & save).I'm vegetarian and was getting a bit underweight, so I needed to supplement with some shakes that were healthy (ie, not gooped up in hydrogenated corn oil and sweeteners).  I also am blessed with a fairly sensitive stomach, so I  didn't want to go with super-processed whey proteins or estrogenic soy proteins.  And finally...I wanted something I could mix into things that wouldn't taste artificially sweet or, well, weird. So I got hooked on this protein and it's been a staple ever since.There are tons of things to love about this protein. First, I like about it is that it's a synergistic blend of many types of proteins - pea, rice, amaranth, chia, etc - so you're getting a full spectrum of healthy proteins. Another plus is that it has probiotics - helpful for digestion.  It's also not heated, there's no stevia or other sweeteners so it's like a ""blank palate"" for making it salty, sweet, spicy, etc. (The possibilities are endless - I've made it into a hummus-like dip, sweet smoothies, added it to cookies and baked goods, sprinkled it on fruit and yogurt..) There's a lot of powder in a scoop (compared to other proteins out there), but it's not super high calorie and has a high percentage (80%) of protein. Finally, it doesn't taste FOUL. I mean, I have tried plenty of proteins - basically everything that's at your local Whole Foods - and some of them, especially the pea-protein-heavy ones like PlantFusion, taste salty and funky.  This one I've actually grown to like. I've had it plain (mixed just with water), with almond milk (gives it a nice ""caramel-y"" undertone), with fruit and coconut milk as a dessert, and even in a blended soup.  I felt amazing after starting to supplement twice a day - I'm much more muscular, feel more energetic, and am certainly less hungry.Why am I knocking it off one star? First, there is no information about the sodium content on the label. Check out other pea proteins - you'll see sodium is anywhere from 11 - 27% of your RDA.  (Whether sodium consumption really affects blood pressure is another issue, but still - I want to know what I'm consuming.) Given that nearly EVERY protein out there that I've seen has information about this, it's really unacceptable for Garden of Life not to disclose this on the label.Also, note the taste WILL take some getting used to if you're used to the sucralose/stevia sweetened whey proteins or other super-sugary protein shakes out there.  You can start by replacing the sugar with fruit, or maybe add a few drops of stevia. Honestly, though, give it a week or two, and those tastes will start to change, and the natural taste actually becomes something you like. It's nice to give over-stimulated taste buds a break from all that sweetness.I will also say that there are better tasting proteins out there. My personal favorite is brown rice protein - it's smooth, blends really well, and just tastes ""sweeter"". But it's only one type of protein, so I like to mix it up - some days I'll do the brown rice, some days Garden of Life.I'd highly recommend this as a ""starter"" natural protein for anyone looking for a good, complete, non-processed source of vegetarian protein!",Flavor Name: Unflavored,the United States,2012-11-29

This is the first one that I didn't have to ""settle"" for. There are others that I like, but this is the only one that is truly smooth, and can be mixed with water, almond milk, or whatever without using a blender. I was amazed at that. Other reviewers comment on the taste. It is one you have to get used to. Americans are addicted to sugar, and to food, in general. For this reason our taste buds are compromised. We have been led by the media to believe that sugary cereals and other highly processed ""foods"" are ""healthy.""It is my understanding from all the recent research that sprouted beans, nuts and grains are full of life and health, particularly when they are ""raw."" I was pleasantly surprised by the ingredient list for this product when I found many sprouted foods. This powder is easy to digest, and I believe the nutrients are most likely easily absorbed and utilized because of the digestive enzymes and probiotics. I have trouble with my digestive tract, and I had no problems at all after drinking this shake. I generally like to use unsweetened almond milk and peppermint oil in my shakes. As far as I know the peppermint oil helps with digestion. And I like the taste.I'm glad I found this powder. I plan to take it camping, along with dried foods. The price is great through Amazon, and I always know that Amazon's customer service is unbeatable. They are one of the only companies I know of that allows you to talk to a person who is truly concerned about your satisfaction and will do anything necessary to prove that quickly.Thanks for carrying this product at such a great price.Update: I've tried even more brands since I wrote this review. I always come back to this one. Not for the taste, but for a few other reasons:1. It's only 1 point on Weight Watchers.2. I can always digest this, without any bloating or abdominal cramping at all.3. I add my coffee to it for an iced coffee drink because the acid in coffee hurts my stomach and bladder. This product must be alkaline because it seems to neutralize the coffee acid. No stomach or bladder pain.The taste is not great and it's gritty. I put one packet of stevia in it. It's worth it to feel so good and it's so easy to stick to a Weight Watchers using this. I will keep buying this.",Flavor Name: Unflavored,the United States,2012-01-16

This was my go-to protein supplement for many years, but each year they change the formula for the worse and lie by calling it “new and improved"". The taste and texture may be improved but its health benefits certainly are never improved; you just get lower-quality ingredients and cheaper fillers while paying more for it. Here is a list of changes that show why no one should waste their hard-earned money on this trash (refer to my pictures to see the changes on their packaging):1) This product used to have no pea protein, (one of the cheapest and lowest quality of plant-based protein next to soy) now it almost 100% pea protein and Nestle is peeing on their customers and calling it “rain”. It’s not even sprouted pea protein even though they deviously list it under their “sprouted protein blend” heading.2) This product now contains erythritol as a cheap sweetener. Erythritol causes bloating and gas and is their cheap and inferior substitute for stevia. If it originally had erythritol I never would have bought this product.3) This product now contains guar gum as a cheap thickener with no nutritional benefit. This might as well be sawdust, added weight for nothing.4) This product no longer lists what foods their added vitamins and minerals are sourced from, and their mineral profile has been reduced. Most vitamin C that is added to store products is sourced from lab-grown black mold grown cultures and is of poor quality, while this product used to derive most of its added vitamins from more high-quality brewer’s yeast. Since they no longer list the source of the vitamins, it is safe to assume the worst as they wouldn’t hide it if they were proud of it and the FDA does not require them to list it. This product is also longer a good source of selenium, molybdenum, manganese, and magnesium.5) This product is no longer a good source of probiotics. To be considered a go probiotic a supplement should have more than 3 billion CFUs it now has less than 250 million. Not only has the quality of their cultures declined, but I also got a Listeria infection (Listeriosis) from eating one of their products. A probiotic supplement should help prevent you from getting life-threatening bacterial infections, not actively give you one.

Also side note; these huge plastic tubs all the companies use are senseless when smaller pro-eco pouches would save shipping space, create less waste, less petro pollution hurting the climate. Alternates: Coffee type pouch? Woven tight bags with paper linings or plant bags? Recycled bags? Compostable would be fabulous!? Tubs take up too much space in a small cupboard also.

A little pricey though.,"As someone who has taken various protein powders over the last few years, this one has become one of my favorites (Vanilla flavor). Is this powder on the gritty side? Yes, it can be but it really depends on your blending method. I find that using a proper protein shaker cup makes this less gritty and does a great job of reducing any chunks. When I mixed it with just a spoon, it was nearly impossible to fully mix properly.However, the taste alone makes it all worth it. Maybe I'm one of the few who actually likes the taste and texture, but it's way better than any of the other overly sweet, artificial tasting protein powders that I've tried in the past (including whey protein). One day I'll try the unflavored version but the vanilla to me is perfect. It has a subtle taste of vanilla without tasting like a sugar filled dessert drink.I'm rating it four stars for the simple fact that the price has increased in just the few months that I've been purchasing.

I blend this in a NINJA BLENDER.  after the gym each day i drink this!  (can get all these products here on amazon).  Then for heavy metal detox chelating I am using BIORAY NDF PLUS 20 drops 2x a day (taken separately not with this smoothie) (this must purchase from bioray not available on amazon).  so in reading my review keep in mind it is not just GARDEN OF LIFE RAW PROTEIN POWDER that is responsible for my new found energy and strength, but it IS an integral part of it and without it i notice a difference.as to the scare tactic articles and fear mongering going on about this product having dangerous levels of heavy metal???????  i find it a little hard to believe that this product is as bad as the blogger said.  Why?  Because i currently am chelating (on my 3rd month) to help my hand and body tremors (caused from mercury and heavy metal poisoning from dental amalgams) and am getting a lot better and i use RAW protein now for several months.  it seems to me that if this product did have dangerous levels of heavy metal that my chelating would not be going so well and that my tremors would be getting worse, since the cause of them IS HEAVY METAL.however, this is not the case:  my tremors caused from heavy metal poisoning are getting better whilst on this RAW protein product.in any case, having been without RAW PROTEIN for the past 5 days (i ran out $ but ordered more today), i have noticed a total lack of strength and not feel as vigorous in my daily yoga and activities WITHOUT taking RAW PROTEIN.  in fact my tremors seem more shaky without taking RAW protein powder!so there you have it!  proof to me that my heavy metal symptoms are worse without RAW protein, and better while i am using it.  certainly this would not be the case if this product was bad as they are saying.i live in the italian alps and also the US and i have no affiliation with Garden of Life.  i just know that it is instrumental in me getting better and i don't feel well when i go without it for several days and i feel fantastic when i use it.  and i have preexisting heavy metal poisoning, not silly comments like stomach aches or other symptoms that are cited in the comments on the Natural News website claimed to be caused by this product, i had the serious kind where your entire body has TREMORS, so bad you cannot hold a glass of water in your hand without dropping it.heavy metal symptoms are very extreme, tremors are one such sign typical of heavy metal poisoning.  and thus far not one person has gotten tremors from this product.and one person (me) says my tremors actually are getting better while chelating and while taking this product.i would be more concerned with the poisonous water (tap water AND bottled water) in america!",Flavor Name: Unflavored,the United States,2015-02-25

The price is decent, but even more importantly for my purposes, they have plain--unflavored, unsweetened. I don't want any artificial sweeteners and flavors, and while I can't say that the taste is actually good, I don't find the natural taste of whey protein overly objectionable. I add a little malted milk to help flavor it to my liking. Just as important for me regarding this brand is the source: I wanted to know where they get their raw ingredient from. I don't want any nasty antibiotics or hormones such as, apparently, can be found in dairy products and derivatives from certain countries where those substances are poorly regulated or even unregulated. So I wrote to the manufacturer, asking where their raw product comes from. The response was very prompt, as follows: ""The origin of Ultimate Nutrition's Milk protein products (and derivatives such as whey protein) as per our suppliers is The United States of America, New Zealand and Australia."" That's encouraging, though it does hinge on whether the suppliers can be taken at their word. Those countries, on further checking, all have fairly stringent regulations on these undesirable substances. Anyway, it was enough confirmation for me to buy and try it. Barring some laboratory tests that either confirm or refute what the suppliers have said, what else do we have to go on? If their suppliers turn out to be truthful as to the origin of the raw product, I would probably upgrade this rating to 5 stars. If the suppliers were to turn out to be lying and are actually getting the raw product from countries where the use of hormones, antibiotics, and other nasties is poorly regulated, I would downgrade this rating to at least a 3. For now, I'm acting as a sort of guinea pig: if I start growing breasts or some of the bacteria that use me as their host start to develop immunity to antibiotics, I'll know the suppliers were lying.",Flavor Name: Natural,the United States,2011-10-26

I wrote to this seller about this item I received in February as 3 containers. Towards the end 1/3 of the first container, the smell was horrible. I had to throw it away. I opened the second container and the same smell was in there too. The strange thing is the date is 08/21 08/24, which indicates it should last until another two years?

As such, I have tried quite a few over the years. This one - Ultimate Nutrition Prostar (Chocolate Crème) is about average as such things go. I generally use one scoop, once per day right after my routine, and this lasted me about three and a half months. I didn't see significant increases in bulk, but I'm more on a maintenance schedule right now and haven't changed much, reps-wise.It wasn't too sweet, it had a decent, if a bit thinner consistency, at recommended ratios. It mixes quite well - using a shaker cup, I rarely had clumps of any sort. My usual shake include 2tsp of fiber powder and 1tsp of creatine, and with these the shake comes out about right after about 5 minutes. Seems pretty stable, no gastrointestinal distress or anything.Protein-wise, it's a pretty good deal.

Additionally, the 5g of fiber per serving helps keep me feeling full and satisfied throughout the day. It's great to know that I'm getting both protein and fiber in one convenient product.

I compared at least 50 different products, no joke, and this one has everything I wanted. There were of course other good options but they were more expensive and weren't different enough to justify the price gap.I chose the unflavored version and it's definitely that. Putting it in water without anything else is like drinking mildly chalky water, but it's not thick if blended well and is easy to drink. I took the advice on the back of the label and mixed it with unflavored almond milk and it was a huge improvement! I took it a step further and blended it with my marine collagen, a handful of blueberries and a scoop of peanut butter. So delicious it feels like a treat everyday.I've ordered other products from ""Garden of Life"" and they have all been excellent quality with no fillers or artificial ingredients.

When I tasted it the first time, I was VERY disappointed, and had to laugh when I came back to write this, and saw the review stating the person would rather eat their own garbage than have another bite of this - I felt the SAME way! (I actually came up with a whole list of things I would rather eat, which I think included a good portion of the contents of my cats' litter box, but had not thought of my own garbage!)  It was disgusting, and I had a terrible time getting it to go into solution evenly.  However, I stuck it out because it does have a lot of protein for few calories, is full of good stuff I never eat, AND has yet to upset my GI system...which is saying something.  I am now halfway through my 2nd can and I love this stuff!For those purchasing the product for the first time though, I would suggest:  * Mixing the powder with something with a bit of heft and flavor to it.  I still think it's gross with plain milk, but chocolate milk is palatable.  Yogurt is better; I really like it in Silk's Fruit & Protein juice/soy milk product and it is great in smoothies.  * Stir, stir, stir, and stir some more: it takes some effort to get this to dissolve.  I like using a plain spoon (versus one of those special mixing tools, or a shake mixer with a little mixing disc in it), so I can squish any chunks and scrape the sides easily.  Shaking doesn't seem to work - the stuff breaks into little tiny chunks and hides in there...until you are eating/drinking along and then have to chew a bite of mostly powdery stuff, which is pretty gross. It dissolved fine in the blender, though.  * Letting it sit for a minute or two after it is all stirred in but before you eat it.  I think this does wonders for the texture.At the beginning, I could barely stand this stuff, even thoroughly (I thought) stirred into flavored yogurt.  I started adding fruit to disguise the texture and flavor, which brought it up to palatable... now I could lick the bowl clean even once I've eaten all the fruit.  I'm not sure if it is truly an acquired taste or just applying the techniques listed that make it better, but I genuinely like this and will be sticking with it.  I gave it a 4-star review because it is kind of messy...no matter how carefully I scoop I still spill some, which is a little maddening.",Flavor Name: Unflavored,the United States,2012-08-09

Ludwig,4.0,Whole Protein source at good price,"I had been taking whey protein powder and my loved brand discontinued making it.  So off to Amazon I came to search for a new one.  I had purchased a sample of 
  
Vega One - All-in-One Nutritional Shake Packet-French Vanilla SeQuel 10 Packet







  
  
     at Whole Foods, while I liked the taste the price per serving was too high for me (at Amazon would come out at almost $3 a scoop).  This product was suggested by Amazon so I read the reviews.  Took a leap of faith and purchased the container--price per scoop comes out to about $0.90, less if you do the Subscribe and Save.Now for the product---Honestly---my first go at it I thought, ""NO way in hell am I drinking this.""  But I finished it and found myself actually somewhat pleased. It is not fair to the product for me to expect it to taste like my old protein powder.  As I am trying to get away from whey I really wanted to see other alternatives...many of the vegan powders are very expensive and, if based on one protein source, not a whole protein.It definitely has an 'earthy' taste which is a bit overwhelming if you are used to whey protein powders.  Since the protein here comes from sprouted grains, the taste and texture is definitely different.  It has NO sweeteners, which are usually used to mask any 'off' after tastes.  If you are used to a sweetened powder I would suggest using some type of sweetener (banana, stevia, honey etc.)  I mix mine with a coffee/water mix in a blender bottle.  If you have time to use a blender it gives it a much smoother texture.  However, seeing that I am always running late this is not usually an option for me.  Do not let it sit--not saying you have to chug it, but you don't want it sitting too long as it gets thicker the longer it sits.I definitely recommend this product at its current price point $25 for 650grams ($0.90 a scoop).  I mention this only because I've experienced prices sky rocket in Amazon from one day to the next.  I took one star off due to the ""gotta get used to it"" factor---not something I loved from the start.**UPDATE**I have been taking this for couple months now and I slowly started to cut back on the banana, I think eventually I'll be able to cut it out completely. Just a matter of what one if used to  and the old protein powder I used to take was a lot sweeter.",Flavor Name: Chocolate,the United States,2013-06-23

I've had success with live and pill forms of probiotics and have been happy with the results (NOTE: I have been using this for about 10 days). I bought this on a recommendation and have really noticed a difference.My Advice:If you buy the Unflavored - well it does not taste good at all. When I saw titles that said ""yum"" and read the packaging calling it ""pleasant tasting"" you have to know it's not.  My boyfriend called it a vomit shake and he's been subjected to every kind of smoothie I've made with crazy ingredients. I said it's that versus his belly and he said ""I'll keep the belly!"" which he worked hard to exercise off.  It's been a week and I'm not picky and am used to eating healthy-tasting food but this is pretty awful even when mixed with blueberries (though I will try the bananas as someone else recommended. I will also try the Vanilla or Choco version - I wanted to see if I could like this first. I tried to mix it in with my oatmeal (since i've sprinkled other vanilla protein powders on breakfat foods with success) and forced it down but it was not pleasant.Aftertaste - Sometimes I will take a little almond butter on a spoon as a chaser. Right now, I'm eating some fennel seeds (what they serve you at Indian restaurants that can freshen any tongue!) But actually I find the more water you use with it, the less it sticks on your tongue.Filling - I feel more satiated throughout the day. I mostly eat eggs/dairy/fish/poultry for protein and sometimes just feel sluggish and get crazy hungry. If I don't take it in the morning, then I take it mid-afternoon and it tides me over before dinner.  I also noticed that I'm seeking less savory/sweet snacks since I started - maybe this is just me, but putting it out there.Poo - The main reason I'm taking it daily is this reason. I feel like my digestive system is working better. I eat lots of veggies and fiber and was taking psyllium husks (warning - never take more than you need - I learned the hard way) and drink lots of water, but I have never shat better than I have this week. Seriously.So I never write reviews and shop on Amazon weekly but I had to say that I will buy this again when it runs out. Try it and see if it works the same for you. I will never buy vanilla whey protein or super green protein mix again.Happy Poo'ing.",Flavor Name: Unflavored,the United States,2013-11-14

He eats about 10-11 hrs later when he gets home.  We all know that's not healthy. So, I sent him a care package of the chocolate flavored one and some coconut milk powder. He said it doesn't taste like most of those protein shakes, and this one surpasses others that he has tried by far.  He now enjoys an on the go breakfast drink in a to go powder mixing tumbler (has a round wisk-like ball in it) and he shakes it as he heads out the door.  He has a very physical job, and he said it keeps him going for several hours, and is very satisfying.  A WIN WIN all the way around!

It's a fact of life for living on earth. Garden of life is not adding mercury to their product, it's naturally in the plants they source the protein from, the same as tuna tends to be high in mercury. As far as mercury and most heavy metals go, you can find more specific information if you are really troubled by them, but you have to understand that our bodies are outfitted to live on this planet that is full of heavy metals. We have systems in our body to chelate and remove things that are not used by the body. There is generally a set rate our bodies can shed heavy metals at, so your health is only at risk if you consume enough heavy metals that your body cannot keep up with the process of removing them and they build up to unsafe levels over time. Garden of life products shouldn't contain any more of those metals than if you just ate the raw rice, peas, and beans yourself.I feel it is a quality product for nutrition, but the taste and texture.....is horrendous. This coming from someone who can easily eat any veggies raw, not dunked in ranch. This stuff is gritty and the chai flavor is mediocre at best. Combined with other sources of texture and flavor though, it's not bad. Just ice and almond milk would probably do the trick for most.For anyone who doesn't know, proteins isn't just protein. There are many proteins used by plants and animals, and proteins are made up of different amino acids. When you eat protein, your body doesn't just take those proteins and stick them together to build stuff like little legos. Enzymes in your digestive tract break the proteins down into their base amino acids. Those are carried through your blood stream, and our body makes it's own proteins from them. The amino acids that humans need are not necessarily the same that you would get from proteins found in say rice for instance. Especially the appropriate ratio of those amino acids that humans need. If you get just a rice protein powder, it is highly ineffective for human nutrition. Garden of life gets around this by blending proteins from multiple plants together that does provide the proper blend of amino acids for your body. Even if you buy another brand, make sure it is not just pea protein, or just rice protein, it needs to be an appropriate blend of amino acids to be useful to your body.",Flavor Name: Vanilla Chai,the United States,2015-02-11

Digests well.,"There are some important things to realize about this Garden of Life ""Whey Protein"".1) It includes ingredients other than whey protein.  It uses milk protein in addition to whey protein (the 2 are different). The ratio is 85% Whey Isolate, 15% Milk Protein.For those new to using whey protein, there are 2 types.  Whey Concentrate is the original structure of whey and includes a small amount of carbohydrate sugar and fat (around 1-2 gram each).  Whey Isolate is the filter forms of whey concentrate which has the sugar and fat removed.  Isolate is essentially pure protein.2) Garden of Life Whey contains filler ingredients that make the drink a little thicker than a 100% whey protein drink would be.  For anyone who has had 100% whey concentrate or 100% whey isolate, they know that the powder mixes into water to create a cloudy white drink that feels a lot like water.  Whey does not make the water thick.  Garden of Life added different types of plant fiber, plant gum and plant lecithan to thicken the drink.  Garden of Life's way is not very thick - it's about the same feel as low fat milk.  However it's noticeable thicker than than 100% whey would be.The big question is, how do these filler ingredients affect digestion?  The Garden of Life Whey does digest more slowly than both forms of 100% Whey (Isolate digests faster than concentrate).  The feeling in the stomach is not heavy like a plant protein drink would be.  But it is heavier than 100% whey.  As a result, the Garden of Life Whey gives more of a feeling of being satiated / full.  My thoughts: For someone wanting a pre-workout or mid-workout drink, stick with 100% Whey Isolate.  For a post-workout drink.... if you want the fastest protein absorption, stick to 100% Whey Isolate; if you want to feel full to help you make it to your next meal, then this Garden of Life whey would work for you.These filler ingredients are Organic Tapioca Fiber (IMO), Organic Gum Acacia, Sunflower Lecithin3) It tastes very sweet.  Garden of Life put some sweeteners in this Whey so it won't takes like Whey.  I think it tastes more like a fake-flavored milk shake.  People with typical America taste buds will likely enjoy the fake vanilla or chocolate flavoring.  I tested both flavors.  100% Whey tastes like unsweet, very diluted milk.  This Garden of Life Whey taste is bold.  The sweeteners used are: Organic Erythritol, Sea Salt, Organic Stevia Extract (leaf)The first time I drank this Garden of Life Whey, I was overpowered by the flavor.  I don't eat sweets or any ""Standard American Foods"".  I eat whole organic foods with minimal natural sugars.  Most of my carbs come from vegetable fiber.  So this Garden of Life drink nearly knocked me over.  However I wanted to give this drink a fair go.... and after 2 days my tastes buds adjusted.  The drink was still the sweatest thing on my menu by far, but I wasn't overpowered by it.  It was still very sweet tasting for me.I don't think that most people will be overpowered like I was.  Most people eat sugary foods throughout the day.  For the common shopper, this Garden of Life Whey will likely be appreciated and help them to stay away from more harmful sweet foods.My Final ThoughtsI plan on continuing to use this container until it's empty.  I doubt I'll buy another container in the future.  I have been using 100% Whey Isolate and 100% Whey Concentrate (no fillers, no sweeteners, grass-fed cows) for years and enjoy the somewhat bland taste.  I do not have digestion difficulties with the Garden of Life Whey but I do recognize that my stomach feels Garden of Life's Whey more... and I prefer to not feel my Whey before or during a workout.  I also want the best absorption and I practice simple food combining in my diet.  For these reasons, I'll keep this Garden of Life Whey off my menu.  However I can recommend it to others who don't have such a fine-tuned diet or strict personal preferences.  If you like vanilla or chocolate milk shakes, you'll really like this Garden of Life Whey.",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2017-02-23

If you can trust the label,"It’s been a few YEARS since I’ve gotten whey protein. I think 2013 was the last time I got whey and it was the natural Whey from Optimum nutrition. My friend got me paranoid about non organic whey and over the years, I didn’t know which brand to consider when getting organic whey, and all the brands were very expensive for the content. Besides, I felt eating quality meals or getting some organic, raw Whole or skim milk could be sufficient enough to substitute for Whey protein. Still, I just discovered this stuff 3-4 months ago, and have been using it ever since. It’s very light on the stomach. Meaning, I drank 2 Scoops, yesterday after my gym visit and It wasn’t thick nor heavy. 2 scoops and not much water. I’ve found when mixing, to use very minimal fluid. The more fluid, the more foam. If you’re using 1 scoop, use less than 4 ounces of fluid. Shake it for a few seconds and check to see the consistency. Two scoops, less than 12 ounces of fluid. This stuff is very light, and the liquid form seems very runny, not thick. I guess that means less fluid if you want it to be slightly thicker. I’m not sure if it helps my sore muscles heal faster, but it says bcaa’s and glutamine and I like that. If you can trust the label, then those are great levels of both bcaas and glutamine per serving. Before this powder, I’d get the garden of life raw meal. But with that, the levels of bcaas and glutamine were more vague. With this powder, the levels are on the front of the package. Still, I like the raw meal being dense with organic fruits and vegetables and FIBER! But plant protein digests differently than animal and again, the levels of bcaas and glutamine are vague with raw meal. Anyway, a “bottle” of this powder lasts me about 2-3 weeks. I only take on days I workout and if my muscles are still very sore. It doesn’t satisfy hunger, but it’s whey protein which is fast burning. Anyway, I like it. And you have to check prices because some places are under $40, and others are over $40. It’s nice to get a quality whey like this. That is, if you can trust everything on the label about the quality. Another questionable thing about plant protein is lead content. Animal protein doesn’t have that, I don’t think.

I'm comparing this Garden Of Life product to my long- time favorite, 
  
ON Performance Whey Chocolate Shake







  
  
    .What's in it: On a ""macro"" level, both drinks deliver about the same amount of protein, BCAAs, and glutamine. However, this Garden Of Life product also lists probiotics as well as a lengthy amino acid profile - the ON product doesn't mention any of it. Also, this product has less calories (120 vs. 160) per drink, and a whole lot of organic ingredients down to the sweetener (organic stevia). On the ON Performance Whey tub I'm reading things like ""titanium dioxide"" instead (and, for comparision, sucralose as the sweetener).Taste: I compared both protein powder's taste when mixed with water as well as sweetened (90 kcal per 8oz) almond milk. When simply mixed with water, the On Whey Performance powder has a fairly pleasant taste. If you use less water, you could mistake it for chocolate milk! The Garden of Life product has a much stronger cocoa taste, akin to eating very dark chocolate. Furthermore, I found it has a (to me) somewhat unpleasant aftertaste, but that could be because I'm not very used to Stevia. When used with almond milk, the Performance Whey powder got very thick, almost like a milkshake, and the Garden of Life product became more ""rounded"" (to me), but still not to be mistaken for a dessert-y drink.Overall, I prefer the taste of the ON powder which almost counts as a treat, but I appreciate the makeup of this more ""serious"" post- workout drink. Both now have their place in my life.",Flavor Name: Chocolate,the United States,2017-01-13

This stuff is the best if the bunch. In taste, mix ability, muscle care, etc. Sometimes I'll eat nothing but protein pancakes for 3 days straight and be fine with it. Feels like I'm cheating. Tastes like vanilla birthday cake. Mix 3 eggs, 3 scoops of this, and a few splashes of almond milk (check the label, almond milk can be 17g of carbs, or 1g. I buy the cheapest stuff from Walmart or Aldi's that has 1g or even <1g carb). Mix it all up, if it's too runny, add some more powder. Put the batter on a griddle after rubbing it down with butter. Flip after 3 mins. And in about 5 mins you'll have the best tasting pancakes. I like lots of butter and that's my diet - high fat, zero sugar which some day increases testosterone. Out of all the proteins on Amazon, all in the $35-$55 range for 4 or 5 pounds, nothing works as well as this stuff. Adding baking soda only makes it bloated and brings out the egg taste way too much so I skip it. If you want to lose a few inches in 3 weeks, each these for 2 meals a day. Or, do yourself a favor and get a good shaker cup. You can make a 75g protein milkshake in one cup and you're good. Bottom line is, I've bought them all, tried them all, and Dymatize Elite is by far the best in all categories. Tastes great, truly. I feel like I should be getting fat eating this and drinking this because it's so tasty. It's worth the extra few dimes a day! Save yourself the trial and error and several hundred bucks - I did that for you. One caveat- I can only vouch for vanilla. It's my favorite but I can't imagine it's much different in other flavors. I like syntha-6 cookies and cream too, but it didn't cook as well. Sandy pancakes. Enjoy! Grab a tub.",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2021-12-22

The price on Amazon is a huge value for this size too!It mixes easily into liquid (I use almond milk) and I also use a high speed blender with ice and a frozen banana. The (gourmet) vanilla flavor is the only flavor I’ve bought because I can use it to make EITHER a fruity shake or chocolatey shake just by adding cocoa powder. If I don’t have time to blend a shake or I want something to actually “eat” vs drink. I’ll add 1/2-3/4 scoop right into my instant oatmeal.Getting more protein daily into my diet has been much easier with the help of this powder. I’d highly recommend trying if you haven’tfound one you like yet.Also- there is stevia along with other “natural” artificial flavors.

I have recently switched to a plant-based diet which means cutting out whey protein sources. To be honest, I do like the taste of some of the chocolate whey protein products I have had better, however, I think this tastes quite good and has a smooth texture considering it is basically concentrated, liquified amaranth, artichoke, pea, and quinoa protein. More than anything, after about 10 seconds, it has a slightly strong pea aftertaste but not so strong that you want to rinse with water or gag or stop drinking.So far I have had none of the digestive disturbances I encountered with the whey powder protein I used to take. I felt a little more constipated and sometimes my farts would smell like rotten egg from the whey. Although it's only been about a week, I haven't had any digestive problems or disturbances with Plant Fusion.MY ONE MAIN PROBLEM with this otherwise fine product is that it is sweetened with Stevia, a natural plant-based sweetener. Although ""natural"" sounds good, there has been research showing that humans have the same specific gut bacteria that the science lab rats do. The bacteria in these rats (and us) digest Stevia into a mutagenic compound, basically a toxin you do not want in your body. The World Health Organization has set a safe upper limit for Stevia based on this research, which, according to one nutritional doctor, is about two Stevia-sweetened beverages per day. But with PlantFusion powder, I have no idea how much Stevia is in each scoop of the protein powder, and because of this, I will not be purchasing another tub until the Stevia is removed. For my remaining supply I will only be consuming 1 scoop of powder per day, whereas if the company removed or replaced the Stevia with something safer (see below), I would consume at least 2-3 scoops of PlantFusion per day.Here is one of the stevia-related studies:Mutagenesis. 1996 Nov;11(6):573-9. Evaluation of the genotoxicity of stevioside and steviol using six in vitro and one in vivo mutagenicity assays. Matsui M, Matsui K, Kawasaki Y, Oda Y, Noguchi T, Kitagawa Y, Sawada M, Hayashi M, Nohmi T, Yoshihira K, Ishidate M Jr, Sofuni T.If any company representatives are listening, might you consider switching to the only known safe artificial sweetener, erythritol. It really is the only artificial sweetener that doesn't have any problems/side effects associated with it. It is naturally occurring in pears and grapes, so it's not exactly artificial either. Please see Dr. Greger's video on the safety of erythritol here:[...]Also, erythritol may do more than just sweetener your beverage or protein powder; it may have anti-oxidant properties-- none of the other sweeteners can boast that!If this switch was made or at least an unsweetened version of this product without Stevia was made available, you will have me as a customer for life, buying a tub every month from age 30 to 100. (I've decided I'm living to 100.)Overall, if you don't care about the Stevia issue, this is a very fine product, tastes decent, though not outstanding, and provides the right amounts of amino acids and protein that someone who is plant-based, vegetarian, or vegan might need, especially if one is an athlete.",Flavor Name: Chocolate,the United States,2013-05-08

I tend to shy away from most dairy and soy products. I used to use Whey Protein after my workouts because of the cost (one of my good friends works at Vitamin Shoppe and I got discounts) and the great amino acid profile. Never really enjoyed the taste of that however, and dairy derived proteins can also be detrimental in some cases. I for example broke out quite a bit and I could tell my hormones were being affected; never had any digestive issues with it, but it just wasn't doing it for me.So I started looking into dairy-free alternatives (which I should have done in the first place considering I haven't had milk in over a year now, which is defeated by the purpose of having whey protein which is derived from milk protein) about half a year ago, and boy, this is great! Not only does it have a wonderful taste but it also does not contain ingredients which are potentially harmful to your health in the long term (unless you're allergic to any of the grains this product uses or ingredients).Taste: It has a slightly gritty consistency but only enough to where it adds texture and enhances flavor. Never have my protein shakes come out too thick or undrinkable, I actually really look forward to drinking a shake with this after my workout. I've tried the Chocolate Raspberry, Cookies N Cream, and Chocolate; by far Chocolate Raspberry is my favorite followed by Chocolate. They all however have great tastes in my opinion.I tend to have a scoop of this, unsweetened almond milk, a couple of walnuts, half a banana, and sometimes a hint of peanut butter or some blueberries. Again, definitely recommend this protein just solely on the taste and simple ingredient profile.As for the amino acid profile, it's pretty darn comparable to Whey Protein (for those of you who are concerned), I honestly feel this protein works a lot better for me personally. I'd definitely give it a try if you're on the verge of doing so.The cost is definitely not too pricy. A 2 pound pod contains 30 servings (each scoop is a serving). I personally found myself going through these a bit faster as I would sometimes have a shake in the morning and at night. Especially after running when I woke up early in the morning, I'd mix this with what I described above and Orac Green Powder and this was like godsend. Then at night I'd just have a scoop with some milk after my workout. Definitely keeps you from staying hungry. If you're cutting (or even bulking I guess), it's great. You just have to know when to supplement and make sure that you're using this AS a supplement and not a replacement to your actual nutrition.Will definitely be sticking to this protein for a very long time.

So I've been looking for non-dairy alternatives.  I've tried this Plant Fusion one, PEScience Vegan vanilla one, and the new Blogilates vanilla protein powder.  My priority is mainly flavor & texture because I mix with water and/or almond milk (I don't do the shakes, oatmeal, etc.).  So this review is based almost solely on that.  Blogilates one tastes the best (almost no aftertaste), but has some texture and can be lumpy.  It is not very good with just water - too thin.  The almond milk gives it a bit of heft and it's just better to drink.  PEScience has a HORRIBLE aftertaste - I really hate that one (their whey/casein regular ones I've tried don't have this aftertaste); less lumpy but does have a bit of sandy texture (not too bad though).  This Plant Fusion one doesn't have much flavor....there's almost no vanilla taste.  It's VERY finely milled, which means it can be dusty/messy to use, but also means when you blend it with almond milk/water (usually I do a 50/50 blend) it's REALLY thick - like a milkshake.  For me personally, it's too thick.  It's like drinking a milkshake with no flavor, but a strong stevia aftertaste.I think the best thing flavor-wise is monk fruit extract and little, if any, stevia.  I really don't like stevia aftertaste and it's pretty much a dealbreaker.  The Blogilates one is more expensive than this, so I was hoping since this one has monk fruit sweetener that I would like it as much/more.  But I definitely don't.

However, this Complete Protein Creamy Vanilla Bean has brought me to this space, to caution those who may be hypersensitive to sweeteners.For well over a decade I was using Pure Plant Protein and Pure Greens made by Nutragen, which were costly but phenomenal products prescribed to me by a naturopath. I have been in search of a protein powder ever since the company was sold and their products discontinued.This protein powder, despite no evidence showing a correlation between Stevia and anxiety, seems to cause an immediate anxious storm. I imagine that this is due to the brain perceiving such a sudden rise in intense sweetness that one does not need an insulin spike to initiate an anxiety/adrenal storm. What I was able to note was a rapid increase in my pulse rate which lasted for well over an hour after each smoothie challenge.An increase in heart rate has been noted in the literature with stevia.I note that in addition to stevia there is monk fruit in this product - why the need to add such intense sweetness to a product?I called the company but because I purchased it through Amazon, they seemed less than willing to acknowledge my concerns. They assured me that there is an unflavored Stevia free option. I do not need my protein powders to have a taste for the powder is part of a breakfast smoothie I make which also contains kale, blueberries, glutamine powder, chia and flax seeds, cacao nibs, turmeric powder, magnesium, macadamia nuts and oat milk.This has truly been a frightening experience and I urge caution to those for whom stevia may not be the friendly plant based sugar alternative.I gave three stars for ""blending powder"" as the powder is so very fine that one can inhale it as it is so airborne (so caution there as well). If one puts the powder into the liquid the blending is more reliable. I have always put my frozen blueberries, followed by kale and then my powders followed by the milk alternative. Doing it this way resulted in pockets of congealed powder that were impossible to blend. Oh dear, the search shall continue.",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2023-11-11

They say that Serving Size: 1 scoop (approximately 30 g).  Servings per Container: 30.  Well according to then it should last 30 days, however this is my fourth purchase of PlantFusion and I only get 26 to 28 days per container.To understand why, I did a Statistical Analysis of this product during the month of February and found out the reason.  Here is the data that I obtained:Measured Gross Weight of Plastic OnlyPlastic Lid -------------------------  20.3 gPlastic Container ---------------- 107.2gPlastic Scoop --------------------  8.1gLid Sealant -----------------------  5.0gTotal Weight of Plastic --------  140.6gMeasured Net Weight of PlantFusion in ContainerGross weight with Product ----  1054.4gTotal Weight of Plastic ---------  -140.6gNet Weight of PlantFusion ----  913.8gThe manufacture overfilled by 913.8g – 908g = 5.8g (Good for you manufacture, I know that this  type of powder is hard to measure accurately)This is what the Manufacture calculates in daysNew Weight of PlantFusion ----  908gPowder per Plastic Scoop ------  30g ApproximatelyThis should Last ------------------  908g | Days  = 30.27 Days  30g |In actual use, it only lasted ------  26 to 28 DaysThe Statistical Quality Control of PlantFusion Plant Protein was set-up as followsThe test would run from 1 February 2015 to 28 February 2015 inclusive.  The sample number would follow the date number and run from 1 to 28 inclusive.  On each date, five scoop samples would be taken using the 8.1g plastic scoop.  The plastic scoop would be heaping and leveled off with the straight edge of a knife so that it was flush with the top of the scoop container.  All the 140 data points are net weight in grams.  Data was product on Excel 2007 worksheet.NOTE:  For those skilled in Statistical Quality Control Data, I can send you the actual 140 data points along with the Average Bar x and Average Bar R chart by contacting me at: Hischild32@comcast.net.You will see from the Bar R chart that the process is out of control do to the compression variability of the powder.  Also its high air float capability is a factor in product loss.  The x = 35.0g and the R = 1.0Please do not call me by telephone . . . I’m deaf.Now, in plain English the Grand Average of each scoop was 35.0g and not 30.0g (approximately as stated.)  The Range variable of the Average scoop ± 1.0g from the 35.0g Average.  In actually some of the data points were out far more than that, due to the compression variability nature of the PlantFusion powder and the air space between the various particles.Since the manufacture has no control over how the various folks do the actual scooping this is a tough problem to solve.  However, the manufacture has a possible solution to this problem to get it more in line with his 30.0g by not selling it in bulk form, but instead, packaging in premeasured plastic cylinders and package them, 30 pieces to a container.  This of course would raise the cost of the product.Also, if there were too many complaints, he could change the size of the scoop to get closer to the 30.0g average.Regards,Jerry Dyben",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2015-03-05

    . In my experience, it is nearly as hard to find a non-vegan protein that doesn't have a ton of crap in it as there is to find a good vegan protein that doesn't taste like chalk.Enter Plant Fusion! I currently have the Vanilla Bean flavor, and based on my love of this one, I will likely try more flavors one I run out of this one. The first time I tried it, I did find it a bit chalky BUT it is much LESS chalky than others. I also found that the more I drank it, the more I enjoyed it and got used to the flavor. I also love that it is a vegan protein that isn't loaded with sucralose or other sweetener to try and hide the vegan taste. I do detect a BIT of that overly-sweet non sugar sweetener in this protein, but it is so dramatically better than others I am willing to work with it.For reference, I mix this with water and it tastes good. I have experimented mixing it with mostly water and a small amount of coconut milk which is good and makes it a bit creamier. I have also tried blending it with water and mixed fruit (like pineapples and strawberries) for more of a smoothie feel. Personally, the sweetness of the fruit and the sweetness of the protein powder was a little much for me. I am going to keep trying with other fruit though. The best way I have made it so far is to stick a cup of coffee in the fridge for about 30 mins, then shake it up with the PlantFusion and blend with ice. YUM! The protein powder adds just a nice hint of sweet to my coffee and I can kill 2 birds with 1 stone.In short, if you're looking for a vegan protein that doesn't taste awful, isn't full of fake sweetener, and has a good calorie to protein ratio, this is for you!",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2016-04-11

I won't pretend like it tastes good (I got chocolate), the stevia is a bit overpowering and cloying, but it doesn't taste bad either. It just tastes, you know... healthy, but also highly processed. It mixes very well, better than any other kind of protein I've tried, whey or plant. It keeps me full and feeling strong for much longer than when I'm not taking it, so I avoid over-eating, and it's comprised of ingredients that don't bother me.I'm sensitive to gluten so it's important to me that this product contains no barley/wheat/oat grass (they may be healthy, but not for me), and rice is often contaminated with heavy metals so I'm also glad it's free of that. I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan, but this seems to be better than whey in terms of overall nutrition because of the added potential for small amounts of fiber and vitamins/minerals to be present in the product, plus it's cheaper than organic whey (the only kind I'd buy). Whey is still probably better for muscle building though, but I'm more concerned with overall health benefits than muscle maintenance alone.Additionally, I've tried a plant powder with chia in it (Life's Basics) and it made me feel very sick, so I'm glad they skipped the chia in this one. I'm also thrilled that there is no added lecithin in this, because gut bacteria turns the choline present in lecithin into an artery-clogging substance, and it makes it hard for me to breathe after I eat it (doesn't matter if it's soy or sunflower, gmo or not, it all does this to me).Overall I'm happy with this product and would buy it again, I only wish it had less stevia and tasted a little bit better. All things considered, it's pretty good.

After some hunting around I came across PlantFusion. It's been a good option for me and gives me roughly the same hit of protein as my former shakes. My only complaint would be the synthetic sweet flavor. Unlike most people, I just find ""sugar-free"" tastes chemically, and it's not unique to this product, just a feature I'd rather avoid. I'd prefer something with a bit more bitterness than the sugar-free flavor of sweet - and I'm certain I'm the only person who has this quirk. Other than that, it's been great. I've tried the chocolate and the chocolate berry (they no longer offer just berry)... both have been good.ADVICE: never mix ANY protein shake with just water, you'll be sorely disappointed by how quickly your gag reflex kicks in. ; ) Always mix it up well using a shaker cup (you won't get clumps that way). I always mix mine with soy milk, almond milk, or in a pinch, lactase. Something I discovered recently is if you add a dollip of plain yogurt to your shake before you mix it up, it gives it a delicious tang and helps cut the sweet.These shakes are a great way to kick off the day if you're too busy to whip up breakfast, are looking to supplement your diet with more protein (perhaps you're vegetarian or don't eat enough animal proteins)... either way, it's an excellent supplement to a healthy diet.UPDATE: I recently purchased the Vanilla flavor... I found it to be WAY too sweet. The Chocolate and Chocolate Berry seem ok to me... still sweeter than I might like, but not out of control like the Vanilla. I'll probably use that just for smoothies where I have some tart fruit that needs something sweet to cut it, otherwise it'll sit in my cupboard for a long long time.",Flavor Name: Chocolate,the United States,2012-11-06

For those concerned with how it tastes, turns out plants don't taste like milk.  Who would have thunk it!!!  Seriously, how on earth is vegetable protein supposed to be creamy and smooth?  To expect this is just a little bit silly and naive.  It strikes me as identical to the absurdity of those who judge tofu by the standards of beef.  They're completely different things!There are two drawbacks to this protein powder, though.  The first is that it doesn't dissolve all that quickly. When I used whey, a few shakes of my bottle and it would all dissolve pretty much instantly, but with this stuff, I'm still walking to my car, shaking the dickens out of my bottle, waiting for the last bits to break free from the bottom of the bottle.  This is kind of annoying, but not as annoying as imagining what goes on in an industrial Chinese milk processing factory.  The powder is also just a tiny bit gritty.  And by ""a tiny bit"" I mean that it's barely noticeable.  Yes, it doesn't have the texture of milk, but that's because IT ISN'T MILK!Once you realize that plants and dairy are simply unlike in kind and you apply a modicum of intelligence to realizing that you can't judge the former by the standards of the latter, you realize that what you're working with here is a pretty solid product.  In case I haven't made my point (pronounced ""agenda"") clear, for me, dealing with slow dissolving, slightly gritty plant protein is infinitely easier to deal with than knowingly supporting an industrial Chinese milk processing factory.",Flavor Name: Chocolate,the United States,2012-08-24

As for the product, there's nothing wrong with it at all; it tastes great (I got the chocolate flavour).  I looked forward to it every evening, and it mixed wonderfully with my unsweetened almond milk.  However, I started having problems after a bit.  For about 2 months everything was fine, then I noticed my throat would get itchy after drinking the protein powder drink.  I ignored it at first, thinking I was just getting sick, but it persisted.  It got worse.  I started having runny nose, coughing, etc., and I realized it was happening within an hour after my drink.  I started eliminating items from the mix:  greek yogurt, banana, almond butter, almond milk.  It still persisted.  So, even though I didn't want to, I stopped drinking the powder.  My problems stopped at once.About a month ago, I bought it again to see what would happen.  Again, the same exact series of events played out, and I started doing a process of elimination on the ingredients to see what was causing my issues.  I'd narrowed it down to pea, artichoke, or amaranth.  After a bit more fiddling and a phone call to my nurse mother, who got her hospital dietician involved, we determined it was the peas.  I was having most of the symptoms for pea allergy, and had I kept taking the powder I might well have had a very serious medical reaction.  I loathe peas, and the last time I attempted to eat them in any normal quantity, it made me sick to the point of throwing up.  Now I know why.So, beware.  If you do, or think you might, have a pea allergy, avoid this.  It's a damn shame, too, because it tastes amazing.  I don't taste pea flavour at all when I drink this, personally.  Anyhow, just be cautious.

Also not sure what the silica is added for. Nine times out of ten I go with the chocolate flavor. I've also tried the vanilla and, most recently, chocolate raspberry.

Jackson,3.0,Stevia taste is overpowering.,"I was very excited to try a cookies n cream vegan protein powder, but I'm slightly disappointed.I greatly enjoy the 21g of protein while most other products offer 15g for a similar serving size. The powder mixes well in liquid, no need for a blender to smooth it out and minimally chalky compared to many other brands. It seems you must often choose between chalky, gritty, or chunky in your protein powder, but I would much rather have it be slightly chalky than have it not mix in and remain in chunky globs.However, the taste leaves something to be desired. I've been vegan for 9 years now and am quite used to the earthy taste of rice/pea/soy/hemp protein powders. This though, tastes very artificially sweet, almost chemically. I assume this is because of the stevia in the powder along with the added fructose. If you have not tried stevia before, it tastes like a mix between black licorice and splenda. It is often used as a ""natural"" alternative to sugar or zero-calorie sweeteners, however it is still a processed product as the stevia leaf must be processed to obtain a concentrated sweetness in liquid or powder form. I would MUCH rather prefer an unsweetened but still flavored powder as many other brands make.As for the taste of the cookies n cream flavoring, it simply tastes like vanilla with a hint of chocolate. If you happen to have both chocolate and vanilla protein powders already lying around, try mixing a ratio of 1 part chocolate to 2 parts vanilla and it will taste almost identical to this product. I often do this on my own when I don't want the chocolate to be over-powering and it is quite delicious.I will probably not repurchase, but it's not so bad that I won't finish what I have. Overall, it is a decent product, I just can't get past the horrible stevia aftertaste.

Honestly, what protein powder doesn’t have a little grit to it? Any who, I like this brand because it blends well and I was able to get the sample pack before purchasing this entire bucket on Amazon. YES YOU CAN BUY A SAMPLE PACK for $10.00 USD, before you buy entire container (http://www.plantfusion.net/products/sample-packs ).So I was able to decipher which flavor I wanted. I went with the unflavored when I did the 10- Day Green Smoothie by JJ Smith since I didn’t want to alter the flavor of the smoothies. Now I also chose this brand because of the following listed on the PlantFusion website: “The scores a perfect 1.0 on the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS). PDCAAS is the gold standard for rating the quality of protein for human nutrition. PlantFusion was designed to be a simple, delicious tool to help you achieve your health and fitness goals.The protein in PlantFusion is perfect for muscle energy, managing appetite, and overall recovery from exercise and daily stress.

It is a very fine powder, very easy to shake up in my shaker bottle even without the stainless steel wire ball. It does not come out with a gritty taste it is smooth. I use it in 8 ounces of almond milk instead of the 10 to 12 ounces that it says on the package. it just helps to make the flavor a bit more bold.  I have since added fruit, cinnamon,  vanilla and raspberry extract etc. so of course it's tastier.  I ran out of milk one day and used water...baaaaaddddd. If you're on the fence about this I would recommend it.  Especially since you can add anything to vanilla to suit your taste.  I have just received the Jarrow Brown Rice Protein Powder...it's awful.

I will agree with some other reviews in that the powder is quite loose, but not at all to a fault. (Good supplement powders should be fine, it makes for excellent blending!) Lastly, I will also admit I was torn between which of the PlantFusion products would be best for me - as I was very close to going with the Organic (for love of the organic obviously but also the fermented ingredients), and I'm so glad I chose this - the debate is over for me after trying this, especially considering you can't use the Organic for baking. I'd be hard pressed to like the quality/taste/nutritional profile of another protein powder more, at any price point.FYI - The primary reason I drink protein shakes/use protein supplements is because I have gastroparesis and am very athletic - if you have digestive issues, this is very filling if mixed with proper accompanying ingredients and digests easily. **I am 100% NOT affiliated with this company or product in any way shape or form, and am certainly not compensated for my comments; I am just a holistic nutritionist/health nut and foodie.",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2017-07-25

It has proven to be accurate too.I normally mix this in a shaker bottle with about 60% soy or rice milk and 40% water. It mixes very well and taste great. I have been drinking the chocolate flavor for months now and still enjoy it and I have a drink almost everyday - sometimes twice in a day.I am also an older guy who still likes to work out to maintain as much muscle mass as I can so getting 20+ grams of protein per serving is a good amount. It's not cheap though, but of the few I have tried this one is about the best cost per serving without a lot of ingredients.

Flavor- It has a subtle flavor that maybe just adds a bit of sweetness and vanilla flavor.  It doesnt completely change the flavor of your smoothie or drink.  It tastes really good!2. Texture- the powder is so fine that it really mixes into the drink well and does not have a chalky flavor or texture like many others- major plus!  You really would not even know it is in the drink.3. Nutritional- it is low carb but about 20g of protein plus has many other vitamins and minerals that are good for the average person but specifically good for vegans or vegetarians.4. Natural, vegan, non-soy, non-gmo, gluten free blend!5. Uses stevia as a sweetner instead of Xylitol6. I make a smoothie in the morning with this powder and am full for the next few hoursI usually use it to make fruit/ veggie smoothies, my husband is super picky and he even loves these!  My favorite recipe is is a faux pina coloda smoothie with a scoop of this, fresh coconut water and meat from a young coconut, frozen pineapple, frozen mango, one banana and some ice- SO YUMMY!!!!FYI- the chocolate flavor is really good too!I am not sure  how some of the negative reviewers saying it tasted horrible or like chalk, maybe they just mixed it with water?  I have never experienced that since I have never tried it.

This is my first venture into protein powders.  Pea protein was recommended since I don't do whey or soy and I was looking for an alternative.  This is a nonGMO product and the sugars are acceptable.  The first time I used it, I used a full scoop in a smoothie.  It was nasty!  The smoothie was way too thick and not enjoyable and ended up in the garbage disposal.  My next attempt was a full scoop in my blender bottle.  The taste was ok but not as vanilla beany as I thought.  Again, still way too thick for my taste.  After the first two attempts, I cut back to a 1/2 a scoop which is perfect for me, added some vanilla extract and cinnamon.  That's pretty much the way I like it now, with an extra splash of vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg or cloves.  I've not worked up the nerve to try it again in a smoothie but if I decide to do that I think I will only use 1/4 scoop.  The protein powder is actually much finer than I expected (I thought the texture would be a bit thicker, I was expecting it would look more like cornstarch).

So, I ended up trying this one. It is the best of the bunch. All vegan shakes have a texture and taste that is not as pleasant as the whey shakes. But, the bigger problem I am having with the vegan shakes is they have too high a level of carbs relative to the constraints I must live within. Thus 4 stars. It is good, but not perfect to meet my particular needs. I may well order it again, but I limit my use of it because of this factor.One of the things I liked was that it was unflavored. I could add unsweetened cocoa powder to make a nice chocolate shake. Or add a variety of spices (cinnamon, cardamon, coriander) and some vanilla extract and make a delicious chai shake.

It's is pretty good but definitely far from perfect. It has a good amount of protein per serving, along with vitamins and amino acids, like most other powders. I like that it's lightly sweetened; while stevia and fructose are in this, the amount of fructose is pretty small (4g per serving), and I'm guessing there's not much stevia either. Most protein powders I've tried have been cloyingly sweet, so it's nice that this one isn't.That said, probably because this is a plant based protein powder, the low sweetness means the flavor is not that great. I don't know if I'd agree that it ""tastes like peas"" like other reviewers have said, but there's definitely a planty bitterness to it. It's also chalkier than any whey-based protein powder I've had. It's not unbearable by any means, but I don't think I'd drink this if I didn't need the protein. I plan to try one of the other flavors to see if maybe chocolate covers up the planty taste more than vanilla does.If you're vegan, this is definitely a good way to add protein to your diet.

The powder itself is very fine which one might think would lent itself to easy dissolution, but NOPE. What actually happens is, maybe 5% of the powder dissolves fairly quickly. The rest turns into a huge gelatinous clump that floats around and resists all attempts you make to try to get it to dissolve i.e. vigorous shaking.The taste... my god. It's just so bad. It tastes how I imagine mold would taste. I couldn't even mask the bad flavor with my koolaid!  I know that this is plant protein and unflavored, but the taste was too earthy for me.Anyway, this is just collecting dust on my shelf at this point.

I'm not sure how they make it blend so flawlessly, but I am happy because of it.As one of the most clean, tasty, and easy to blend proteins on the market, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a plant-based protein powder, extremely satisfied with my purchase!",Flavor Name: Chocolate,the United States,2020-07-05

Plant Fusion is the third brand that I've tried and it is my favorite thus far. Plant Fusion uses pea, artichoke, amaranth powder, and quinoa powder as its protein source which produces a very nice completely balanced protein.I prefer the chocolate over the vanilla as it mixes better and doesn't produce a cup full of floating foam like the vanilla does. They both taste better compared to the other plant proteins I've tried. If you're not a fan of stevia then you may want to steer away.I consume 2 servings (42g of protein) after strength workouts (kettlebell exercises, pullups, pushups, etc) and 1 serving after jogging. It tastes okay with just water but I find myself increasing the nutrient content by mixing in coconut water, a banana, and occasionally a teaspoon of almond butter.There is 4g of sugar per serving coming from fructose which I would like to see eliminated. I don't believe it is necessary for it to taste good and most would benefit from less sugar in their daily diet anyway. I would also love to see them add hemp protein to the mix to make it even more nutritious than it already is. Either way, I will continue using Plant Fusion until something superior comes to the market. The price is reasonable as well.",Flavor Name: Chocolate,the United States,2012-09-12

I have tried almost all the ones carried in the health food stores in my area and almost all were not drinkable.  I'm an extremely picky eater and most protein powders are just awful.  I did some research on the internet and decided to try Plantfusion.  I was a little worried because of the luck I'd had with all the others.  I was very pleasantly surprised with this product.  It mixes well (anyone who says that this doesn't mix well isn't trying hard enough).  I use a shaker and it blends just fine.  It still has a little bit of an aftertaste but it is acceptable.  And yes, it is a tiny bit chalky but nothing compared to others I have tried.  I like that it is sweetened with stevia rather than with an artificial sweetener.  I have only tried the vanilla and am looking forward to trying the chocolate.  I have added a little bit of coconut extract to the vanilla and the result is pretty good.

I mixed with water and was trying to use as a substitute for Medifast shakes which uses either soy or milk, both of which tear up my gastrointestinal tract.  Now if you were using this powder and adding fruit, milk or other additives it probably doesn't taste too bad.  But by itself, with only water, I can strongly taste the ""plant material"" used to make this product.  Tastes kind of like chewing grass to me with a very definitive vegetative taste.  The flavor is most like raw peanuts with that slight bitter finish.  However, I do not notice any strong after taste.  It isn't overly sweet which is nice and the chocolate flavor is more like milk chocolate than dark, so it isn't very intensely flavored.  It is a very light,  nice fluffy powder that mixed very nicely in one of the blender bottles with the wire balls.  No problems there are all.  And is was very smooth with no lumps or clumps as some mentioned.  I would probably continue to use this but the taste is just off putting for me and I can't hide the flavor by using fruit or other items and stay on Medifast.  I think I'll try one of the goat milk protein powders instead since I'm fine with goat milk.  I'll pass this on to my Vegetarian friends.  Calories were 120, with 4 grams of carbs and 21 grams of protein so the protein to carb ratio is excellent for those looking for a low carb diet.

Probably the only time I really notice the super stevia taste in it is if I make it with oatmeal as my only sweetener. The plant protein mix is great so it doesn't taste like sand (rice protein/ hemp protein) or leaves (some other pea protein based brands). Chocolate is super delicious as well. I've even had the plain flavor and it still does the job really well without overwhelming tastes in your shakes.I'm lactose intolerant so that's the main motivation for avoiding whey. Though they claim to get all the lactose out of the protein powder, whey just doesn't sit well with my digestive system. This is great. I have been using it for months and I love this brand.

After drinking Plant Fusion's powder mixed with chilled water (the same way I'd drink ON's natural whey), I'd feel energized and light. I'd feel that way after drinking ON's natural whey typically, but every so often I'd feel bloated and heavy instead. Now, I'm not knocking whey protein, as I still use it because the cost per ounce is more reasonable, but this is simply how my body responded.The only reason Plant Fusion didn't receive five stars is because there was a mild plant-like or grassy taste to it. I could tolerate it most days, but not always. I started mixing in powdered peanut butter in with the Plant Fusion protein to help balance out the flavor, which helped tremendously.Plant Fusion is great, and I'd get it again, but I'm more likely to by Vega Sports plant-based protein instead because it has a better taste; however, it is more expensive, so that is something you may want to consider when purchasing for yourself.",Flavor Name: Chocolate,the United States,2014-05-24

I am a very busy working mom, so this protein powder is a very handy and healthy protein meal for me sometimes up to 3x a day. I always buy the unflavored version. The taste, well italmost has no taste, which is what I like makes it the winner for me. I just mix it in water, add some green powder to get more green veggies and bam, perfect meal that gives me energy for hours and hours and I always have it after my hour long workout. This protein powder is truly amazing. The powder is so fine and easy to mix, when you read the ingredients info on the bottle you realize with each drink of this protein mix, you are doing something very very good for your body. Complete protein made only from plant sources, organic ingredietns, lacotse free, gentle on the stomach, no soy, no dairy !!!!!, hypoallergenic, gluten free...., non GMO....well what can I say.... amazing!!!! I will not even start to write all the amino acids it has, list way tooooooooooo long.With each scoop you are getting  22 grams of protein and only 3grams of carbs, wich was very important for me, and only 2 grams of sugar and that is not added, but found in the veggies. I don't know why anyone would want to buy whey protein powder when you can have this. There is nothing on the market that compares to this product, especially when it comes to TASTE and quality.

This is my eating plan for life now.  In one month I had lost 15 pounds;  Currently I have lost 20 pounds with a total weight loss of 85 pounds with 15 to go. This is simply a preface to reviewing this amazing product.  I have experimented a lot with food during my weight loss journey.  I found that a protein shake in the morning sustains me through my workouts.  Since starting Paleo I knew my current whey based and previous soy based powders were not acceptable.  I searched and searched ultimately finding this PlantFusion in my local health food store.  Being budget minded I reluctantly purchased it there.  I went home and searched Amazon for the same product.  I returned the product to my health food store getting a full refund.  I was able to purchase two pounds of protein powder for two dollars more.  Amazon is an amazing shopping opportunity.I ordered the unflavored version because I toss this powder into two cups of frozen fruit with three cups of diet cranberry juice and presto witht the help of my Ninja Blender I have the most amazing breakfast shake.  The powder blends beautifully.I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a plant based protein powder.

Its so hard to find protein powders that are whey, egg and soy free: delighted to find this. I got the vanilla version and I'm enjoying the taste of it. I love that it is a complete protein and digests easily. I had trouble digesting hemp powders and the rice and pea protein powders I found didn't give me a complete protein to add to my smoothies. I didn't think that complete protein was a big deal until I tried this. Hard to put into words but I feel more rounded with adding this to my smoothies compared to hemp, rice or pea proteins.I would not call this powder as 'mixes easily' as the label proclaims. The powder is very fine and clumps easily when adding to liquids. After trial and error, I discovered that adding it in while blending was the best way to keep it from lumping. The fine powder doesn't just rinse off and sticks to glasses and the blender so its a bit more hassle than other powders. It also goes airborne and dusts my blender and everything nearby.I'd like to rate it at 4.5 stars and I'd buy it again.",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2014-11-28

We began a search for a vegan protein powder to supplement our diet in a healthy way.  I tried many different vegan products, but I was not satisfied for one reason or another.  Taste was often the issue and the ability to dissolve easily was another factor.  This is the best protein powder I have found yet for a number of reasons.  The taste is good enough to mix with just water if you are in a hurry.  My husband was using 100% Whey Protein by EAS prior to our switch in dietary practices and he thinks that this product is equal in taste and dissolves almost as readily.  My favorite thing to do with it is to mix it with a cup of soy milk and a cup of frozen strawberries in a blender to make a smoothie. Prior to finding this product, we seldom bought the same protein powder twice.  Instead we kept on searching one after another until we started buying this protein powder. Now it is the only protein powder we use and we are both happy with it.  If you are on a very low sodium diet, the only thing to be aware of is that this product has a bit more sodium than some brands (360mg) per serving. Another positive aspect I have noticed is having this for my lunch satisfies me as a meal on the go and  it appears even to decrease my appetite in the evening.",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2010-12-03

I am fairly new to protein drinks, I'm not an expert on them, but I have tried the Advocare chocolate protein shakes and the Jillian Michael's chocolate whey protein.  I've been on a low carb diet for 40+ days and needed to find more ways to get the protein with low calories and no refined sugar.  So many of the protein powders I looked at had Nutrasweet, or some other type of artificial sweetener.  Stevia is ok on the diet plan I am on and that is the sweetener in this product.  After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  I tried it with just water in a shaker and it was ok but not great.  I invested in a Ninja drink blender and now make it with ice cubes and a little plain unsweetened almond milk.  It makes a nice chocolate malt and the stevia aftertaste is not bad, I feel like I'm having a treat.  Stevia in some drinks bothers me, but I don't notice it much in this powder.  I'm 51 years old and am trying to start a healther lifestyle and better eating habits and I will definitely continue to buy this product.

I've tried so many unflavored protein powders and this is by far my favorite. I don't care what anyone says, I'm not convinced GenePro has the protein claimed. In fact, I'm convinced the only reason why people can't taste it is because the serving size is so small and there's no way it's delivering 30g/in a tablespoon. Isopure, Syntrax Nectar and Quest all had strong odor and flavor that made it impossible to ignore. Once I found NutraBio, I stopped looking. It's the lowest odor and flavor of any brand I've tried for the serving size that actually delivers the protein promised. They are third party verified and tested to ensure quality. I love the brand for this product because I can't stand flavored protein powders after my surgery. My tastebuds have been permanently changed, I can't stand artificial sweeteners and flavored protein powders all taste too sweet even if I cut them with extra liquid. I can also taste all the artificial sweeteners and they nauseate me or give me horrific headaches. This powder has been a life saver for me. I put a scoop in my coffee every morning with a cup of hot milk, water and 4T of vanilla coffee mate creamer. I use instant coffee and this mix just works for me to start my day every day. I'm almost 2 full years post op, I've lost over 100 pounds and kept it off with my routine. I can't imagine my life without this surgery and products like this.

Hull,5.0,"Decent taste, great nutrition","The thing I like about this brand is how clean it is. There are no harmful elements to it, it’s completely organic and natural.Their instructions on preparing it makes for it to be a bit strong. They also recommend using almond or some other non dairy or soy based milk. Personally, I like to make it with fresh whole milk from a local dairy. I’m not vegan, but I do have stomach issues that requires me to use meal replacement drinks on a regular basis.The drinks are very filling, as long as you make it at a decent strength. Of course, you can make it really thick and strong, using less liquid but more powder.When I first discovered this brand, I was in Whole Foods, prior to the takeover. They had reps from the company in there, offering samples of most of the flavors. The reps talked about how they added additional fruits, peanut butter, and other various things to make it more filling.  I tried that, but to me, it altered the taste too much.  I think if you have the chocolate flavor, peanut butter wouldn’t be too bad, but this flavor, Berry, it’s not just s good mix.There is no discernible change in flavor or texture if you add other supplements, such as chia or flax. Before you make a blender full, do a test run with the various supplements, to make sure it tastes good.They also taste good when blended with ice, as a frozen shake.",VINE VOICE,the United States,2019-03-19

Kim,5.0,The best ingredient for a post-workout Ritual of Rejuvenation!,"Years before Starbucks started serving their Oleato drinks (olive-oil-infused coffee), I'd been mixing regular coffee with MCT oil after my workouts as part of my own personal Ritual of Rejuvenation. MCT oil helps your body burn fat more efficiently and is great for weight management. Mixed with coffee, it serves to give me a nice boost to my energy levels after vigorous HIIT and resistance training sessions. And unlike Oleato, one tablespoon of MCT oil dissolves well into a mug of coffee without overpowering it or turning it into an oily sludge.But the real star ingredient to my Rituals of Rejuvenation? Vega Organic Protein Powder! This stuff is just fan-freakin'-tastic! I get the French vanilla flavor and add 20 grams of it to a 10 oz mug of coffee + the aforementioned one tablespoon of MCT oil + half a cup of cold unsweetened vanilla almond milk. The result is a deliciously creamy, soothingly warm, Goldilocks-level-perfectly-sweet, highly nutritious concoction that makes my soul smile and my muscles go ""Ahhhh!""Two such mugs after each workout and I've infused my body with 20 g of plant-based protein and a whole bunch of essential vitamins and minerals. Add to those two mugs a large banana and I've just had a very healthy, energy-giving meal that powers my body for the rest of the day.Each serving of Vega protein powder provides 50% of most B vitamins that your body needs every day, plus 50% of your body's recommended daily serving of vitamins C, D, & K. It's also a good source of vitamin A, Iron, and Manganese.The one downside that other reviewers have noted: Vega Organic is pricier than other protein powders out there, true. But given the high quality of ingredients, and the exceptionally expansive range of nutrients in each serving, PLUS the great taste (and total lack of chalkiness associated with many other protein powders), I'd say it's worth the higher price point.I'm a struggling artist hustling to make a living in an expensive city, but I budget my meager income to make sure I always have enough to afford this baby twice a month.

My doctor suggested this may be stressful for my brain and encouraged I have a vegan protein smoothie to support brain health in starting the day. I bought the sweetened version to avoid stevia and blend it with 12 oz unsweetened almond milk, half a banana, handful of frozen berries and handful of spinach. The banana helped to add some sweetness. I use a good old fashioned blender which takes care of most of the clumps but not all from the powder. With the other ingredients, I’m not getting a clear sense of what the powder tastes like but enough to say it has an earthy taste to it which I don’t mind. I’m going to try a different brand next because the price on this is higher than what appears to be a comparable product and I’m adding in my own fruits and veggies so don’t necessarily need the “all in one” product.

For 3 months I’ve been eating clean which means no sugar or sugar substitutes. I don’t know if that’s why I feel this taste overwhelming sweet or what. I was using a vegan protein that was unflavored and only using banana as a sweetener. My first time using this protein I did it like I usually do with a half of a frozen banana, PBFit, and vanilla almond milk. That was way too sweet! Now I blend it with only these items you see here and with 1/2 cup of ice. It’s perfect for my post workout drink. I do love that I get every mineral, vitamin and nutrient my body needs to recover all in one. It doesn’t taste “gritty” to me maybe, that’s because I only do plant based protein for years now so I’m used to it. It’s a set weight in the volume in the canister so not sure why everyone is complaining about it not being full to the top. Its just that the canister is bigger. We are still getting the exact amount we paid for. Over all I highly recommend this protein. I do not have any stomach issues with it. I feel good after drinking it. I will continue to use it.",VINE VOICE,the United States,2023-09-29

This is in a league of its own. Hold this up to ANY protein product on the market; whey, egg, casein, collagen, soy, etc..  ANY. This tastes like a treat. No weird chalky aftertaste. No earthy “hold your nose while you chug it down” yuck taste. It does turn green when blended but that’s just just the ingredients- which by the way- are AMAZING and high quality. And if you’re like me, struggling with having a sweet tooth, this stuff lets you get away with satisfying that but actually being good for you. With that being said- I’ve tried chocolate, mocha, and vanilla. All are great but ironically, my favorite is the vanilla!!! Just a personal preference.

But I finally decided to try it out after a customer of mine gifted me an amazon gift card. And I gotta say... pretty darn disappointed in this stuff.Idk if I got a bad batch or what. But it has the WORST chemical taste to it. Cinnonon has a pretty strong flavor and I didnt taste an ounce of it. It is definitely sweet. But the chemical taste it has is unbearable. Best way I can describe it is like you washed a cup but didnt rinse all of the soap out all the way and then drank from that cup. Pretty bad...I'm going to exchange this one for the chocolate peanut butter bliss flavor and give them 1 more shot. But if the next one fails I'll just write these off as gross and stick with Farm Fed by Axe and Sledge. Also a very clean protien and tastes fantastic! Give these a shot if you'd like.

FWIW, my recipe is 2 tbsps non-fat greek yoghurt, 1/2 cup frozen fruit, 1 scoop Vega powder, 1 tbsp flax meal or chia seeds (I alternate), 1 tbsp chopped walnuts, 1/2 inch ginger root + water.  I change it up by changing the fruit mix (mango is my weekend splurge!).  I was using french vanilla exclusively, tried this chocolate and I'm hooked!  Another way to mix it up is with coconut water instead of water - especially in the summer!All up, love this chocolate powder for taste, composition (I still take a multivitamin btw), texture (by the time the fruit and ginger is blended the powder is well mixed) and peace of mind!Full disclosure:  I'm a lifelong vegetarian (not vegan but I don't do eggs).Highly recommended.  I give it to my kids - active athletic boys as well.  So you can tell I'm ok with the ingredients :)",Flavor Name: Chocolate,the United States,2020-11-17

But coming from someone who doesn’t try a whole lot of protein powders, this tastes really good. It reminds me of a green tea latte from Starbucks, with a stevia sweetener aftertaste (which I totally get why it would be off putting for some) I’m neither a fan or a hater of the stevia aftertaste. It’s very artificially sweet, but the actually flavor is pleasant it’s less vanilla more yellow box cake like in flavor. The texture however is accurately reported in reviews, it is quite chalky and does not mix well in any liquids I’ve tried so far. 2% milk, whole milk, soy milk, almond milk, all leave large dusty clumps even when using a blender bottle or stirring in a little at a time.One thing to ignore are the reviewers quoting the clean label project. There is no lead or arsenic in here in any detectable amounts that matter. I took several samples to my campus labs and had them tested by my chemistry professor and she had no reason to believe the claims were valid. Also if you google search clean label project there are articles from Forbes that point out how they don’t reveal how or what methodologies they used, what they found, and basically have zero transparency for a company claiming to be transparent.

After quite a bit of research, I chose this organic protein powder from company Purely Inspired.  Per serving, it has 22 grams of plant-based protein (pea and brown rice), only 2 grams of sugar, and no sugar alcohols.  It also has a probiotic, as well as a prebiotic (Inulin).  It has relatively low sodium, a decent amount of fiber, and claims to have zero cholesterol, although the product contains coconut oil which does have cholesterol.The protein powder came in the mail today.  I got the vanilla flavor because I figured it was more versatile than the chocolate.  When you first open the jar, you will notice that the powder doesn’t come all the way to the top, maybe about 80% up.  I used a long spoon to pull up the enclosed scoop, which was about half way down.  After reading other reviews about the taste, I started off with just 1/2 scoop of powder.  I added unsweetened almond milk and frozen berries (blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries) and blended it.  It did blend nicely, with no clumps of powder.  However, it was too thick, so I added water and blended again.  When I drank it, I did notice the vanilla flavor, which tasted somewhat artificial.  It certainly didn’t have an overwhelming taste, as mentioned in some of the reviews that I read.  Next time, I’ll add some honey which I suspect will dampen the vanilla taste.  I’ll also test with other sweeteners such as maple syrup (the real Vermont stuff) as well as carob.Because of its plant-based protein and healthy ingredients, I definitely will be purchasing this brand of protein powder again.Update:  I recently tried the protein powder in the oatmeal I make every morning.  The oatmeal contains frozen berries, raisins, coconut oil, pecans, and unsweetened almond milk.  I added the protein powder and a little extra almond milk.  It turned out great.  I also tried it in pancakes today, again adding the protein powder and a little extra almond milk.  Again, it tasted great.

M.,5.0,Actually pretty good product,"I read other comments and was wondering if I should purchase the product. However, the price was good and I gave it a try. This is my observation:- Flavor: comparable to other products (Garden of Life, etc). Not too tasty since it’s not very sweet but quite nice chocolate flavor (compared to other chocolate pea protein powders that I have tried). Chalky taste? Not as a few options I tried before. It could be different with other flavors (vanilla, etc but I didn’t try those so I don’t know)- Blending: I just tried to blend it with room temperature water and it’s perfectly easy to blend. Some got stuck on the tip of the spoon but it’s not difficult to use a finger to push it down the glass and stir all to dissolve. The blend looks a bit shiny and we’ll blended.- Value: for 18 servings, each with 22grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber, low carb, this is great value! I tried a few options before and they are very similar but at higher price points. Not $15 for 18 servings!! This is less than $1 per glass of high protein, easy to digest and won’t clog your stomach.- Vegan friendly: okay mine only says could processed in facility with eggs and coconuts. I know it’s not ideal for vegan (I’m not a vegan). Quality could be issue as some people complained their product labels show processed in facility with milk, etc- Design: this product looks totally similar to quite a few other products so I have no comments about their brand distinction in terms of standing on the shelves at all. All have green cap, white plastic box, label with lots of veggies, letter fonts, etc- Shipping: 2 days, packed wellShould I buy it again?

     I literally laughed out loud when I got my Vega one berry today!  I have several different serious conditions and need to have optimal nutrition to help support my body and make and make my medications work better. I cannot take any kind of synthetic vitamins or minerals so I rely on Vega for my nutrition and have for years.  Honestly, I would have to put a small scoop of Breyers natural vanilla ice cream in my smoothies sometimes because the texture was a bit gritty no matter how much liquid I added and the taste of some flavors just was not all that great.  But I'm a realist and I understand that this is made of all fruits and vegetables and is all natural.  Also the probiotics are some of the only kinds I can tolerate so I've been a dedicated and faithful customer for years. Since I love to add berries to my smoothies, I figured it was time to try the berry flavor as I had tried the chocolate, the vanilla and the chai. When I received the tiny container I was surprised but even more surprised at the amount that was inside!! I figured the small size of the container was due to their policy of using recycled plastics which I'm a huge fan of but wait---- see video",Flavor Name: Berry,the United States,2022-05-10

I use this daily.,"Out of all the various plant protein powder mixes I've tried, this one is my favorite. Others might be slightly less expensive per pound, but two main reasons keep me coming back to this product.The first is taste. It doesn't jump up and down on my taste buds and scream ""awesome flavor,"" but it not bad at all.  I find the vanilla to be more enjoyable than the chocolate, but I mix them up for variety's sake. What stands out to me is how much smoother this stuff is than the comparable product at Costco.  Both are organic, but wow - that Costco stuff tastes quite chalky compared to this. This product blends up pretty smooth. If I'm in the mood for something sweet, I add a bit of stevia powder to the mix.The second reason I keep using this product is the carb and fiber count. Not only does this product have 7 grams of fiber per serving, it has only 9 total carbs.  Using the method of subtracting fiber from total carbs, that means I'm consuming only two ""net"" carbs per serving, which is quite beneficial for when when I'm eating a keto diet.  Comparable products have anywhere from 5 to 17 carbs per serving, depending on the brand.  If I put on a few pounds, I can lose them pretty quickly eating high fat / low carb, with 20 or fewer carbs per day.The high fiber content also helps keep my cholesterol in check.  I strive for a minimum of 30g fiber per day, because it absorbs the bile in the small intestines which keeps the bile from being reabsorbed by the body and turned into cholesterol.  By increasing my fiber intake and cutting out all processed food, I was able to significantly lower my cholesterol from 235 to 178 in just three months. By maintaining my fiber intake, my cholesterol has stayed at or near that lower number for two years running. I obviously can't promise everyone that result -- and so that the FDA doesn't harass me, I should say that this statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration, and that this product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.  :-)I first found this product at Wally World, and at the time of this writing, the retail price for a one-time purchase on Amazon is the same as Walmart. But for the past few months I've had this on ""subscribe & save,"" which brings the price down 15%.Only one time did I have a problem with the delivery - someone at Amazon packed it alone in a large box with no air pillows, and all the jostling in transit caused the lid to come partially off.  I opened the box to find a lot of powder!  A simple email to Amazon solved the problem - they paid for me to ship the opened container back and they sent me a new one lickety split.  Also, every once in a while, the tops on these containers don't snug up all the way when you tighten them. Twice in the past year I've had tops that ""jump"" the threads. It's not a big deal ... it just means you shouldn't carry those particular containers by the lid when putting them back in the pantry!  That said, most of them snug up just fine.I believe this product to be a great source of organic plant-based protein. As for making drinks, I use this product daily as part of a power-packed smoothie. By the way, to enhance the nutrients in that smoothie, I almost always add a scoop of

Some of us take our own supplements and loved this brand because it was a more cost efficient way to get pure-plant-based protein for those who want to tailor their supplements and use this in a shake or smoothie.  Now, it has effectively raised the price per gram of protein and some of us are reconsidering GOL for a little more—and a lot more in return.

I let one more subscription cycle go through out of laziness/curiosity to see if this protein really had been giving me so much trouble (before branching out I had assumed it was due to poor sleep and some other lifestyle factors) and decided it is definitely not for me.

This is the first plant protein powder I tried, after realizing the whey protein I liked had a ton of cholesterol. This definitely took several days to get used to. The taste is very different. I had to mix it 50-50 with some chocolate whey protein to be able to stomach it. I like the flavor now, but it was strong and different at first so it was a bit of a struggle to adjust. The scoop is really big, I find that where I used to use ¾ scoop now I just use ½ scoop. I also noticed right away that it has a slightly grainy mouthfeel, but I guess I’m used to that now too. I do enjoy this product now, and I feel like it’s healthier than the whey protein, though I’m not vegan or vegetarian, I am glad I was able to sub in this plant-based product.",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2023-03-13

I've been ordering this protein powder for nearly a year. I probably go through about 2 containers a month. I just got my newest order in, with it's sleek new clear container and updated packaging. That says it comes with ""60% more"", however a quick comparison next to the current container I was using, I can see there is now 20g of protein/serving vs the 22g it currently had. It also has 1g LESS fiber and 1g MORE carbs. While these are minor changes, it is disappointing, why are these changes necessary? I checked my amazon account today just to confirm these changes were listed and while the picture is accurate, the description still states 22g of protein which is misleading and false. It is still a very good powder with a good flavor, so I'll most likely continue to order, just not sure why the changes were made?So I am just starting a weight lose journey. A friend of mine suggested adding in some protein to my day. She mentioned doing organic, I came across this item on amazon. It had mixed reviews but most of them are regarding the vanilla. I have been using the decadent chocolate for about 2 weeks, I mix into a smoothie with banana, strawberries and water. It taste DELICIOUS! I really enjoy it, which makes me concerned maybe it's not that healthy for me? IDK lol but I'll take it. If I had one critic, I do get a little taste of powder even after I've blended for a while, I'm not sure if thats due to my cheap blender or it's ability to blend but it's just worth noting nothing to complain about!",VINE VOICE,the United States,2022-07-06

I had seen other reviews saying to start with a half a scoop before I ever tried it and I'm glad I always read reviews first. Because a half of a scoop is a very strong taste . Can't imagine a whole scoop It would overpower my smoothie immensely.But I know others would enjoy it and are prob used to the taste.

I mix it with Greek vanilla yogurt amongst the other things I usually add to my yogurt (I do granola and pomegranate seeds and stuff). The only flavor difference I can tell is that it makes it much sweeter. I have not tried it with milk yet, though I will soon.

Everything except the ever increasing realization that my morning protein shake was giving me extreme abdominal cramping. Not to mention horrendous gas that was becoming very difficult to hide. I was popping gas pills like candy and it was doing nothing to curb the stomach pain and bloat. As I said, it took me awhile to narrow it down to the Organic Protein, but having not had a shake for 5 days, thankfully the gas has subsided. The constipation remains.

I bought this because it was on special and ""nearly"" matched the ingredients and numbers for protein, sugar, carbs, and fiber of my usual protein powder. But I'm confused re' ""20 servings"" because I'm not certain what a ""serving"" is in this case. Is it ""2 scoops"" as stated on the label? If so, that's 78 grams/serving because the scoop is 39 grams. And 680 grams total divided by the actual 78 grams/serving as stated on the label, is only 8.7 servings instead of the ""about 19 servings"" as stated on the label. Or is it ""36 grams"" as stated on the label? If so, it is one ""scant scoop"" per serving, not two scoop because one scoop is 39 grams. I went to the manufacturer's web site; alas: no customer service! I asked the question in the ""community"" here because sometimes we get lucky and the manufacturer actually responds. At this point, with my brief experience and the information on the label, I would not recommend this product if you shop for taste and value of product, including number of servings for the price.Update-- 2 canisters later:While I have an ongoing attitude about manufacturers including an inappropriate measuring device, I feel better about this one for two reasons:1) I used the measuring device included in the canister, shook off the excess, and actually counted for myself the # of servings/canister.  18.5. So the statement on the label, ""about 19 services"" is the truth.2) As a Blood-type A who is supposed to shun dairy products, I am not concerned about whatever minuscule amount of dairy would show up in this product just because is is ""processed in a facility that also processes milk...""",Flavor Name: Chocolate,the United States,2018-03-14

I decided to go on a smoothie cleanse this month.  In the past I have went on smoothie cleanses however this this is my very 1st time using a protein shake,  therefore I have no other protein shakes to powders to compare this to. With that out if the way, I purchased this Vega Protien Powder, all in the same size,  in the flavors of Vanilla, Caramel Toffee and Strawberry Banana. I tried them in the past couple of days in the order mentioned above. I have only used one scoop per smoothie. I am using this smoothie as a meal replacement, only drinking it once a day, and along with the powder I am adding one or two spoon full of frozen fruits, one or two hand full of  fresh vegetables, almond milk, plain greek yogurt, and sometimes I will add ground cinnamon and a small dash of maple syrup to mask the flavors of the powder. I first mixed the powder with almond milk, very well, then incorporated the other ingredients afterward. For curiosity sake, I have tried all of the flavors with almond milk alone and with water, alone. Being that I have only had this protien powder for a couple of days, I honestly cannot judge it by its nutritional value as of yet. However preparing it as a hearty smoothie and only drinking one smoothie a day with nothing else other than a cup of hot tea at bedtime and water through out the day, has kept me satisfied and energized all day long, without feeling like I am starting myself. The texture is not chalky and the powder seems to mix well with the right amount of almond milk or water. I prefer it with plain almond milk as I find it to be more tolerable that way when drinking it alone. Out of the Vanilla, Caramel Toffee and Strawberry Banana flavors, I find the Vanilla and Coffee Toffee to taste the same, except the Caramel Toffee has a slightly salty after taste. But honestly, if someone blindfolded me and had me drink the Caramel Toffee, I would easily mistaken it for Vanilla. Neither if them taste good in my humble opinion. The Strawberry Banana isn't much better but it has a slightly more tolerable taste, especially while drinking it with just almond milk and it smell better. I believe I read somewhere in these reviews that it tastes like Caption Crunch Berries and I agree that it does taste like that but maybe like a less sweet version of it. My only major concern is that at the end of the ""simple"" ingredients, it says ""Natural Flavors"" but since these natural flavors were not specified and  listed it makes me feel like the company has something to hide. I bought this protien powder after researching many of them because I trusted this one will be the healthiest but not knowing what all the ""Natural Flavors"" are makes me feel a particular type of way. I took a picture of all of the powders as they are immediately after opening them, before using them and it is dissappointing to see that all of these containers are about half way full. If the company isn't going to fill it up, they need to put the formula in smaller containers. Despite what the serving size says, on the container, its deceiving and annoying that Inhave to stick half of my arm in, to get the scooper out and scoop up some of the powder. None the less, this is one of the least expensive protien powders I have seen on the market, and from what is provided on the packaging, it seems to be the healthiest choice, at this point in time. For those that are hyped up about buying the Caramel Toffee flavored powder, it may not be worth they hype. Too many people hyped it up which is why I bought it, but I'll try it again with two scoops next time to see if I can taste the different between this flavor and the Vanilla flavor. Your best bet may be Strawberry Banana if you are looking for flavor but don't plan on adding other things to it and Vanilla if you are going to incorporate other flavors to the drink. I also noticed the difference in the prices although they are all the same size, I don't know why that is, but if you are budgeting, it's worth paying attention to. None the less, I wish everyone buying these products the best....cheers to having better health!",Flavor Name: Strawberry Banana,the United States,2022-08-08

In the last couple years, I've moved away from protein powders simply because eating ""actual"" food is more satiable. Lately, I've incorporated protein powders into my diet for the sake of timing/speed to get to adhere to my schedule. I typically consume a protein shake (I keep it simple - in water, whole milk or sometimes nut based milk) or mix into oatmeal for breakfast in the mornings after I workout. No, I don't  believe in the anabolic-window bro science. I've tried basically every protein type (isolates, concentrates, blends, casein, etc.) out there and almost every brand. I prefer pure casein because I like my protein thick and casein will do that. I keep seeing vega everywhere I go (I've bought their protein/snack bars numerous times here - delicious) and got me interested in plant based protein. The only protein powder I've bought in the past that had plant protein was SAN's Metaforce and DYMATIZE's Elite XT (before reformulation). the soy protein was listed latter but it always had a nutty taste to it similar to soy beans.Anyways, saw a deal pop up for VEGAs protein+greens here and pulled the trigger. I always do my due diligence before buying a product so I knew this was stevia sweetened and i HATE stevia. no matter what you do, there is that gross (to me) aftertaste of stevia. I researched everywhere to find a sucralose or any artificially sweetened plant protein but to no avail. I get it - these brands want to promote a ""healthy"" ""lifestyle"" by using organic ingredients but from what I've read stevia also goes under a lot of processing. anyways, I hate stevia.with that being said the protein wasn't too bad. it had a green/brown color and smelled earthy. I liked the fact that this powder was not as powdery as some milk based proteins (where regardless of how careful you are, the powder goes everywhere).it can be easily mixed with a smooth and dissolved quickly without chunks.now taste...this is purely subjective but i definitely did not get ANY hint of vanilla and yes, I got that horrid stevia aftertaste. from a sweetness standpoint its in the middle (tried with with 8oz of water, whole milk and cashew milk). I also mixed it in oats and consistency wise it was on par with a casein blend protein. not watery but not too thick.macros...110 calories for 20grams of protein in a 30gram serving size....so 10grams of ""greens + filler_""overall I would have enjoyed this protein more if it wasn't sweetened by stevia. i would have been ok if they threw in actual sugar and maybe some erythritol ontop of that. i think they could easily get away with 130 calories a scoop with the added sugar and erythritol is basically negible.Keep in mind (for men) 1 serving contains 30% of your RDA of Iron.",Flavor Name: Vanilla (Discontinued),the United States,2018-01-17

So amazing I'll probably be converting to just using PE Science. I had been using Ghost and Devotion Nutrition. PE science is superior to both and I'm saddened that I still have allot of the Ghost and Devotion to use up before I can move on to PE science. The flavor is there and not over powering with the protein. I've successfully made several different items with adding very little calories to it to maintain my bariatric diet after gastric bypass. I do not have any GI sensitivities either with PE Science which is a +. PE Science makes great ninja creami ice creams and bakes very well. I'm really impressed with this product and the flavor line.3rd - customer service even while ordering through Amazon is great. I was not expecting samples but much to my surprise I got samples in one of my orders that introduced me to another flavor I haven't tried yet.

I definitely liked the flavor and it blended very nicely and smoothly with almond milk (no clumps or anything), but the bag suggests mixing one scoop (about 33 grams) of the powder with eight ounces of water.This is nowhere near enough liquid. At those ratios, this stuff was unbearably sweet. Like someone dipped their fist in full-fat chocolate milk, then in Nesquik powder and hot cocoa mix and punched me in the mouth with it. I'd like to point out that I can eat straight buttercream frosting without issue for a reference point for my sweetness tolerance. When it's too much for me, it's SWEET.That being said, the remedy for this overpowering sweetness is to simply use more liquid when blending your protein shake. The bag says to use eight ounces of water and I used about 16-18 ounces of almond milk and it was perfectly, deliciously sweet.I recommend this brand and flavor and I will definitely buy it again because with the right amount of liquid to mix it into, it's a very tasty chocolate protein powder! I just have to encourage potential buyers to either use twice as much liquid or half as much protein powder when making their shakes with this product.

I didn't realize that the 'serving size' would be so large either.  Okay, this is why: the scoop was buried so deeply in the powder that I didn't find it for several days.  So ....  how could I know how much to use?  The label says 1 Scoop, or 30 grams.  Well,the scoop was a mystery, and I am not a mathematician and didn't bother to google the conversion.  I used a TABLESPOON, and when I finally dug out the scoop, I discovered that it holds 1/3 cup!  Oh boy.  First of all, the only smoothies I make are with fruit, and the ingredients in this super-powder don't exactly go with fruit - but at 1 Tablespoon, I dealt with it.  I don't makes green smoothies or whatever they are, with all the veggies, but I thought adding some powdered greens and protein would be good for me.  Once I realized I am supposed to use roughly five times as much powder as I had been using, I started rethinking the whole smoothie thing!  I did finally figure out how to make it work for me, though.  I only use 1/2 scoop, and I dissolve it in hot water before adding it to a smoothie.  Even though I use frozen fruits, the hot water resulted in a cool smoothie instead of nice and cold.  The solution to that was to put the finished smoothie in the freezer for a bit and then blend it again.  You can tell the powder is in there, compared to a non-powder smoothie, but it's drinkable.  Even though I'm not getting the benefits of a full serving of the powder, I still feel as though I'm doing myself some good.  All in all, I'm glad I purchased this and I'm sure I will do so again.  Meanwhile, the canister will make a great cookie jar.  (I may not EAT green, but I try to LIVE green.)  =)",Flavor Name: Vanilla (Discontinued),the United States,2016-05-23

Phillips,4.0,"Not terrible but very sweet, artificial vanilla taste","i bought the Vega Protein and greens because it was close to Shakeology and that product is very expensive at 129.99 per month. I bought both the Garden of Life Fit Vegan Nutritional Shake for Weight Loss in coffee flavor, and Vega Protein & Greens, Vanilla. I wanted to try both for a month and have some variety plus neither one had a month worth of servings per container on its own. I actually liked the taste of Fit better and it mixes smoother.  There was considerable settling in the container so that it appeared packed down and half full but I assume that occurs during shipping, so I just gently shook the container and let the dust settle before I opened it back up, which fluffed it up and will probably make it last longer. I will probably add a banana next time or try some almond milk. The Fit is a little watery. The Vega is a little bit thicker but a tad gritty. (I bought the ""Blender Bottle Classic Loop Top Shaker Bottle, Clear/Blue, 28-Ounce Loop Top"" from Amazon and it works great to blend the powder. It's only $5.59 for the blue with loop top.)  I plan to update this review with more info in time. :)  UPDATE: I have to say I prefer the Fit over the Vega. I can tell a difference in feeling full and I am less easily tempted to eat something else when I have the Fit for lunch. I like the nutrition profile in Vega but the flavor is just so artificial and sweet. Vega may be a litter better choice just for the nutrition, it is comparable to Shakeology but much cheaper. I like Fit for the way it keeps me from being tempted to overeat or eat something not so healthy.

I use a Vitamix blender so that does a great job making this into almost a milkshake consistency. The protein powder can mask a lot of the other flavors so the smoothie predominantly tastes like the powder, but I liked it. It's an 'earthy' taste but I'm a fan of stuff like that. I've used a frozen fruit medley of papaya, mango and pineapple and I've also used frozen bluberries and both are really good.

I ordered a second small bag to try another flavor, and got samples of others in the order! That was super nice- they were generous with the variety of samples.

I was so glad when I found this Vega Essentials shake! I absolutely love the chocolate flavor! I have tried the vanilla, but don't like it as much.  To me, the chocolate flavor kind of tastes like chocolate cake batter...yum!I drink this shake every morning! Because a smoothie is the only thing I eat/drink for breakfast, I usually mix one scoop of this powder with a cup of frozen berries, a teaspoon of almond butter, a banana, a cup of almond milk and a handful of spinach.  This is my favorite smoothie mix! I find that this gives me the energy that I need! This shake keeps me full for several hours! Sometimes, if I am out of frozen fruit, i will add 2 bananas and a little more almond butter! The almond butter makes it extra smooth and creamy.  I have seen how some people find this shake to be a little ""chalky"" and I think adding almond butter or even a little bit of yogurt helps to make it creamy and not chalky!When my toddlers started seeing me drink this shake, of course they wanted some too! Now I make them their own smoothies with this every morning! My one son is extremely picky, but he loves this smoothie, so I know that he is getting some important nutrients! Even though I knew this shake was safe for my toddlers, I did double check with their pediatrician about it and she approved!

I bought one of these tubs instead of other, higher calorie brands, because the ingredients looked good and simple. My husband was able to manage this, as a supplement to a scant diet of mashed potatoes and other bland, pureed foods.

This helped him get back to a healthy weight. He continues to use this a few times a week, and plans to continue.This product is a pea based protein powder drink. It has a lot of good vitamins and amino acids in it. My husband just mixes it with water in a mug and drinks it. He uses the vanilla flavor and while it isn't something he drinks for enjoyment, he's pretty picky, and he doesn't find this objectionable. Since he has a sensitive stomach, this veggie based product works well for him (animal products and artificial products usually give him trouble).Once he got back to his usual, healthy routine, my husband reviewed his vitamin regime.

After researching further, I found that the ""study"" never actually posted any reports on their methodologies or their rating system or the amounts of ""heavy metals"" they claimed plant based proteins were so high in. Plant based proteins are made from plants and plants absorb stuff from the soil. For example, raw spinach has 60mcg of cadmium, but this trace amount is expected and allowable in products, especially in products that minimally processes their ingredients. So whey proteins might be low in this ingredients, but they aren't plant based and they might be processed more. Vega did come out with a statement saying they were surprised by this report because they test all of their products for these things. Clean Label Project has also been unclear about their funding sources, they say they come from consumers and grants but don't say where those grants are coming from. Could they potentially be from animal based protein companies because they have seen a huge decrease in sales as vegan and vegetarian lifestyles has increased as well as allergies to animal based products? Potentially. I wouldn't be surprised in the least if that were the case.So long story short, I'm going back to vega as both the taste and quality of the product is excellent! I've missed it, especially since I discovered I have lactose intolerance and cannot have whey protein. Can't wait to have this staple back in my pantry and I, as a consumer, need to be sure to research a bit more before automatically accepting a report. I'm usually more of a skeptic and didn't pay attention to those red flags the Clean Label project had such as their language when describing trace amounts of heavy metals, their lack of honesty about funding, not reporting their methodology, and not really saying how they actually rated products.I'm back Vega!",Flavor Name: Vanilla (Discontinued),the United States,2018-05-21

I decided to try Vega since this brand is vegan and I wouldn't have to worry about the milk part. I got the berry and when I first opened it it smelled of light berries, nothing overwhelming, so I was hopeful that it wouldn't be too artificial tasting. On first sip I liked that it wasn't too sweet and it did have a light berry taste but for the most part you can still taste and feel the grainy and real ingredients that are in there, giving it an earthy sweet taste which is a little off putting. I decided to chug it and it goes down really smooth like water would, so it's pretty easy to drink in my opinion if you don't like the taste. I do feel more comfortable drinking this knowing there's no preserved animal products in it so I can overlook the funny taste. Overall I'm pretty happy with it.

I mix one scoop with one glass (1-2 cups) of water. Most negative reviews are because of the taste, however, this depends on people. My first Vega product was the vanilla one, which is delicious. Going from that to this is a shock, but if you're committed to not using Splenda or artificial flavorings, after the first 2-5 drinks you will honestly develop a taste for it. I have a glass every afternoon as part of my new lifestyle and I'm losing weight and staying fit.It blends perfectly. The trick is to fill the cup with water first, then put in the powder, and stir. If it doesn't mix well, you're probably not using enough water. As a chemist, I have a habit of using as little solvent as possible and then bring to volume, but that doesn't work here. Also, the powder is light as heck and staticy, so it tends to get everywhere when you scoop it out. It would be nice if a future formula or container didn't do this, but it's a minor complaint and worth dealing with given how good the product is.I don't know of any studies that have demonstrated the quality of the ingredients, but all I can say is I drink a glass every afternoon as part of my new healthy lifestyle and I've been losing fat, while keeping my muscle mass.

I don't mind stevia but I understand a lot of people don't like it so I get why they decided to make this. However this has zero taste. You use two scoops instead of one and it's 100 calories for only 15g of protein. If it had much of a taste I wouldn't complain but honestly it just tastes like lightly sweetened almond milk once I put it in my almond milk.

Will buy again!,"To be honest, I really wanted to try the Berry flavor, but the reviews were too iffy. I use this protein powder in fruit smoothies, so even though chocolate had the best reviews, it was not appropriate. I am not disappointed at all, though, with choosing Vanilla. It tastes great and makes my fruit smoothies very filling. I will say that I do taste a somewhat chalkiness when my smoothies have a milk (tried 2%, Oat, and Almond) base. But if they have a juice base, it doesn't taste chalky at all. For reference, I normally use 1-1 1/3 cups of liquid per serving and I'm using a high powered blender. So it is possible that if I used more liquid with the milk-based smoothies, the chalkiness would go away, I just prefer smoothies with a thick consistency. Also, I read reviews about the safety seal having holes in it. My jar came with a fully intact safety seal.",Flavor Name: Vanilla (Discontinued),the United States,2021-08-02

I follow a fitness influencer that swears by this protein powder, so I purchased the Snickerdoodle flavor to give it a go.Overall I rated it 4 stars because I can't see myself using this powder everyday after workouts - the level of sweetness is too intense.Protein Makeup: The actual protein composition is really great, especially for folks who lift weights and look to protein for more recovery or cuttingConsistency: Blends well into a smooth shake (I don't use a shaker) and doesn't have a chalkiness like other powdersFlavor: Tastes exactly like a snickerdoodle cookie with a slight artificial aftertaste. If you can taste when there is artificial sweetener used in products -- this results in about half of that kind of taste. However it is REALLY SWEET.Overall, I like the flavor for making protein powder desserts, waffles, fluff, etc. I don't see myself drinking this in the morning every day as my run of the mill, after workout protein shake. I prefer a natural fruit sweetness unless I'm focused on eating something for ""dessert"" and that's what this taste conjures up for me.I'm going to stick to my Naked Nutrition Protein Powder (Whey, Casein, Egg Blend).

So makers often go overboard with either (and in some case or BOTH) of these additives regardless of their origin (traditional sugars or sugar substitutes).  I realize that I'm probably in the camp that I'm in but let me educate you about myself.  I'm a sugar-holic.  I lived on sugar growing up from candy bars to cake, cookies and brownies.  But as I'm gotten older my body had changed ALLOT (now 60 years old) and in the past few years diagnosed with Diabetes II (runs rampant in my family so I guess I was lucky to live as long as I have without diabetes) but as a result of that I'm extremely picky about my sweetener replacements.  I'm a huge fan of Monk Fruit sugar and I do look for that in my protein powders but often times they are doubled up with Stevia (which is usually like 3 or 5 times sweeter than table sugar) so companies, I think, are still getting their heads around these mixtures.This protein powder is good in that it doesn't not cause bloat or gas, mixes up thick (little too much) but the chocolate is lacking.  It's overly sweet and not very much chocolate.  I'm a huge fan of dark chocolate so this doesn't taste like chocolate milk (as mentioned by another reviewer here) nor anything remotely chocolate.  More like vanilla with a little bit of a chocolate aftertaste.So sadly I won't be purchasing this again, I'll keep tabs to see if the company perhaps comes out with a new and improved flavor set.  I'm thankful for the smaller packs to ""taste test"" these products without investing too much money!

After bariatric (GB) surgery, my doctor said I needed 60 grams of protein a day.  A lack of protein after GB results in hair loss, fatigue and muscle wasting.  I only rarely ate meat pre- GB, and even less now.  I began to have the classic symptoms, with the hair loss and fatigue being the worst.  With GB restricting meal size to itty bitty portions, and not being a huge meat-eater, I was desperate to find a way to get enough protein daily.  I tried just about every other brand of protein powder on the market with unpleasant results.  They were impossible to dissolve in liquids, stayed lumpy, had an off-taste, were gritty in the mouth, and were low in the amount of protein per serving.  After reading a magazine article about any contaminants or heavy metals found in commercial protein powders, it looked like ON was one of the safest, so I ordered the platinum hydro-whey in vanilla.  Wow.  No off-taste, it's whey (the best source), and one serving (one scoop) is a whopping 30 grams of protein.  When you first add it to liquid, it appears that while it mostly dissolves (hydrolyzed?), there are a few small lumps.  Just do a very little stirring.  Even so, I can't detect any lumps or grit when drinking it.I hope this helps fellow GB-ers in need of protein sources.  GB is life changing, and finding adequate protein has been a real challenge for me.  I'm not a morning person and can't handle a big breakfast.  A morning drink made with ON works for me and supplies me with half of the protein I need all day.  But you can have them any time you want.  Yes, my hair loss started stabilizing and is getting better.  My fatigue is improving.  I had really gotten myself down a hole 6-9 months after GB surgery, and I don't expect miracles overnight, but I'm really seeing my health improve after getting more protein in my diet.  I'll give my basic recipe for a ON protein drink, but you can try many variations on it.  Good luck to you all in your weight loss and health journey.In an 8 to 16 oz. mug or glass, add 1/2 cup more or less of water.  Add a teaspoon or two of instant coffee crystals (I use Folger's classic roast) and stir.  Add 2 to 4 squirts of Torani sugar free syrup.  Add one scoop of ON and stir.  Add more liquid to taste.  This can be more water, milk (low fat for less calories), coffee and milk, coffee, or?  I then like to add a couple of ice cubes, but that's optional.  The variations on this can be endless.  Use coffee or not.  Use milk or not.  Use Torani or not.  Try different Torani flavor combinations (1/2 caramel and 1/2 vanilla is good).  Vary the amounts/portions of any of the ingredients to taste.  I don't use any measuring cups or spoons now for this.  Less dirty things to wash and the measurements don't need to be exact.  Whatever glass or cup is handy, a spoon out of the silverware drawer and available ingredients, and a scoop of ON.  I haven't tried fruit juice yet, but was thinking that OJ and low fat milk (no coffee) might be creme-sicle-ish.  GB-ers be careful to check the grams of sugars in juice servings.  Not sure if Torani makes sugar free OJ syrup, but I know they make some sugar free fruit flavors.After running out using the small ON container size, I now order the 3.5 pound size and keep a spare on hand.  ON doesn't seem to be available at many retail stores, so Amazon is the best source I've found for speed and best price.  When I occasionally run out of ON and fill in with something else in a pinch - Yuck!",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2013-06-22

    However, Hydro Whey is expensive and a lesser value, but why is it worth it?First off, for all the hard gainers like myself out there, the increased content of BCAA's is important for protein anabolism.  You can only create as much as the weakest link and without a single amino acid or fuel to create the essential ones, you are falling short.Secondly, this stuff mixes like a champ! We've all been there with the proteins that fail to mix well, leaving clumps to swallow and dry powder to lick out of our cups and shaker bottles.  I highly recommend a shaker bottle

     for all mixing purposes, for its convenience as well as efficiency.  However, this is the ONLY protein I've ever been able to mix in a cup when a mixer/blender was not available and there are no clumps at all.  It does produce a more frothy, lighter shake than does Gold Standard or even Platinum Hydrobuilder, making it easier to consume and break down.  The taste is much smoother than its thicker Gold Standard counterpart. It will curb your appetite slightly (characteristic of all proteins), but not as bad as other protein shakes do which can be important when you need to consume that post-workout meal.Now, as to whether ""hydrolyzed"" whey is better than the regular stuff, that's for you to decide.  It has worked for me, and I'm not going back to Gold Standard anytime soon for all the reasons above, but remember scientific 'philosophies' or lab work does not all translate to the same benefits in real-life applications like the human body (where everyone reacts differently).  Hydro-Whey has been a winner for me, and I've tried many, many proteins before: Muscletech, BSN, Optimum, etc.Please do your research as different proteins have different applications and this stuff is reserved for primarily upon waking and immediately post-workout.  If you're looking for meal replacement or anabolic longevity, look elsewhere.  Hydro-whey provides instant fuel when your body needs it most, and to maximize muscle gains, I'm willing to pay a premium after working hard in the gym day in, day out.",Flavor Name: Turbo Chocolate,the United States,2012-04-04

I would recommend it.Longer review:I'll start off by briefly informing you that I use this product specifically to supplement my protein intake after a workout.  Previously, I used Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard Whey for the past ~2 years.  Before that, I've used a few others and concluded that ON seems to deliver the best overall protein.  That being said, I tried ON's Hydrowhey because hydrolyzed whey is absorbed very quickly after consumption.Taste (Turbo Chocolate): 9/10Vanilla soymilk is my preferred base liquid, and this flavor tastes great with it.  ...Probably even better than their Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate flavor.Mixability: 8/10I've used the same blender bottle for about two years as well, and this Hydrowhey seemed to clump up slightly more than their Gold Standard and stick to the lid of the bottle.  Not a huge deal, but worth noting.Ingredients: 9.5/10Lots of protein and not a whole lot of other garbage that a lot of commercial proteins contain.  People will complain about artificial ingredients in their protein, but I'm not from that camp.  Personally, I'd be upset if they started dumping sugar into it.  It's also noteworthy that this protein powder (like other ON protein powders) has BCAAs, which is convenient, so that I don't have to order another product or even risk forgetting to take it.Digestability: 8/10I include this because there's a common talking point about hydro whey being tough on your stomach.  For this reason, I procrastinated in trying this, but I'm glad that I did.  Personally, this maybe had an effect on my stomach about 5% of the time (maybe 2 or 3 days out of the first month that I used it).All in all, I'd recommend ON's hydrowhey.  I only tried their Turbo Chocolate flavor, and it's definitely a winner.  It's a little pricey, but the quality of ingredients and taste make it worth it.

First of all this isn't your run of the mill protein powder. This product contains hydrolyzed whey protein which your body metabolizes much better than other forms of whey, especially whey concentrate (check the labels of most protein powders and see what the first protein listed is, it's probably concentrate). Concentrate is easy to produce and is one of the least efficient forms of whey. It's not that it doesn't work but an awful lot of it get converted into waste. Also, since hydrolyzed whey is metabolized better an added benefit is that it is easier on your stomach (protein shakes don't always agree with everyone).The reason hydrolyzed whey is more expensive is because the refining process is much more involved and the yield is much less at the end of the process. The biggest negative to hydrolyzed whey is the taste. Hydrolyzed proteins typically are very bitter. The ON Platinum Whey tastes phenomenal for a hydrolyzed whey product. If all you want is a great tasting milk shake and don't care about the quality of protein then look elsewhere.This brings me to my biggest gripe with a lot of reviewers. Please stop comparing apples and oranges. Yes it is more expensive than ON Gold Whey but for the reasons I mentioned above there are additional costs in manufacturing and as a result there are added benefits to the consumer. 1 gram of whey concentrate is not equal to 1 gram of hydrolyzed whey. So stop comparing it to the Whey gold gram for gram. It's not just marketing hype, they market it as platinum because it is a better product.I've been using this product for over a year and I've tried a plethora of other brands but this by far is the best tasting hydrolyzed whey formula in my experience. There might be more pure hydrolyzed whey out there but the bitterness is nauseating.This is a great product by a reputable company. It isn't magic and it's not perfect, nothing is. Hydrolyzed whey isn't for everyone either. I agree with other reviewers, do your research. Just make sure you are comparing apples to apples, the nutrition info doesn't tell the whole story.

The short version of this review is that I tried ON's Platinum Hydro Whey first, as a supplement to the P90X formula; eventually ran out of it; tried the other things I bought; and am now giving them away to go back to this!Being somewhat lactose intolerant, I worried that a pure milk product would be a problem, but decided to risk it due to the hydrolyzed state. Perhaps because of that I never once had a problem with this product. (And I see some other reviewers didn't either, although some have in fact had stomach cramps, so apparently it depends on the personal biochemistry. Buyer be warned. UPDATED TO ADD: as of early September 2012, the product now contains a slight amount of lactose. Not enough to bother me, but could be problematic for other people.)I bought the vanilla version (also in other products) specifically for the purpose of adding some protein and now-missing vanilla flavor back to the new version of the P90X Recovery Formula drink. As many people here will be aware, this was a very popular drink in its original incarnation, largely due to its strong mixture of vanilla and orange flavors. The new version tastes more like Tang, but lacks the sugar and vanilla flavor to hide the vitamin/mineral aftertaste.ON Platinum Hydro Whey added that vanilla flavor back to the P90 mix; and also beefed up the protein to carb ratio. (The P90 has a lot more carbs than proteins.) To this I added a bit of real Tang.As other people have reported, the Hydro Whey mixes very easily and thoroughly (even moreso than the P90 mix, by the way, which is no slouch in this department!) On the other hand, I probably wouldn't try to drink this as a straight milk supplement or alone with water, as I doubt the taste, although very good, would be strong enough for me. On yet another hand, the taste has no mineralish bite or aftertaste to it (because there aren't any added vitamins and minerals, duh!)Buyers should keep in mind the report of other reviewers, that ON is being rather misleading about the supposedly superior amount of protein compared to their normal Gold Standard whey products. Mathematically speaking, there is practically no difference. I can't testify to any other differences, although technically I suppose the hydrolyzed state should metabolize much faster (and maybe mixes better). On the other hand, some people don't actually want so quick a metabolization, and would rather have the material digest over time. I don't know enough to opine on the merits of either theory, but as someone who has trouble digesting milk products I appreciate any quicker digestion!Anyway, I'm buying it again and getting rid of the other things I test-bought, as they don't mix as well or taste as good (although the latter is subjective and they do have advantages this doesn't. But of course I'm mixing this with something that has those other advantages already, so...)",Verified Purchase,the United States,2011-12-13

I also noticed myself getting tired of having those over-flavored shakes and also the bloated feeling that came with them as well. This is hands down the best protein I have ever been on period. If used daily after a workout like most people do you will definitely see gains in your muscle mass and physique. Obviously, dieting is hugely important when it comes to weight lifting and looking good but if you want to put on some lean muscle without dreading having to drink a protein that will mess with your stomach or taste buds this is the one. In a matter of 6 months working out 6 days a week eating clean, cutting, and pushing my thresholds I was able to turn 20 pounds of fat into 20 pounds of muscle. I have done this several times now as iv been on this protein for over 3 years and counting. If you are taking your workouts seriously and constantly pushing yourself your body will reward you for buying this protein. Also, I never get bloated after an entire shaker cup with two scoops and milk and that's amazing to me.

A full scoop mixes very well with 6-8 ounces of water in my shaker bottle. Also mixes well with milk, not as good as water, but definitely still good. Try it in a blender for smoothest results!Flavors (that I have tried):Turbo Chocolate (TC) - great all around. Tastes just fine. To me, it's not something that tastes so good that I couldn't wait to drink it, but it does not taste bad to any extent. It's kind of like water to me, I need it, I drink it, and done. Awesome. I give it an 8.5/10 on taste. Next, it mixes so well, sometimes the consistency of the shake was barely distinguishable from water. It's also very versatile! If you plan on adding multiple ingredients to your shake, chances are that TC will pair well. If you're trying the product out for the first time, get this one.Cookies and Cream Overdrive (CCO) - Ugh. No, just no. Don't get it. Protein quality is obviously the same, but just....no. It's especially bad as the first thing in the morning. I give it a 4.5/10. After having TC flavor, I decided to be a bit more adventurous. Got this one in the hopes that it would taste similar to Muscle Milk's cookies and cream flavor and boy did it tank. Optimum Nutrition dropped the ball on CCO. Not only does it not taste good, but it doesn't mix as well as TC does. Multiple times I've had some of the unmixed but wet powder lining the bottom edges of my shaker bottle. Had to dig it out with a spoon. Blasted waste. After my first serving, I dreaded that I had to wait at least a month to finish the stuff and go back to something better.

A little under 1 scoop 2x/day helps me keep my hard earned muscle mass. This Platinum appears to be marketed as higher quality/more effective protein, so I thought I'd try it out, even though the smaller 3.5 lb tub immediately made me suspicious of its value.First of all, the chocolate that I bought tastes fantastic and mixes great. But in comparison to the Whey Gold product, I feel the Platinum is a marketing gimmick and a product that mostly just increases profits for this company without really adding value to the consumer. Why is that?The most obvious trick that I didn't catch when comparing the two before buying: Scoop size/protein in grams. Andy Rooney always complains about this type of thing, so I guess he is my mentor in this case...Whey Gold: 1 scoop = 24 grams protein.Platinum: 1 scoop = 30 grams protein.So you figure you are getting more protein for your buck, right? More protein per scoop? Wrong. The Platinum scoop is bigger! What I missed was the serving size:Whey Gold: Serving size 30gPlatinum: Serving size 39gSure enough. The scoop they give you with the Platinum is bigger than the Whey Gold. Compare the two. I did once I got the Platinum shipment.So is the protein in the Platinum any more concentrated than the Whey Gold? It doesn't appear to be, at least in grams per comparable serving.The other differences...I see they put some ""creamer"" in the Platinum which is not in the Whey Gold. I also think the Platinum might be a little sweeter. My point here is that these 2 features improve the taste/texture of the Platinum vs. the Whey Gold and make you think the Platinum is better. I actually like these changes and wish they'd incorporate them into the Whey Gold - but don't be fooled into thinking the Platinum is somehow more effective because of this (unless taste is more important to you than getting high quality protein at the best price).Yeah, I could be missing something else here. Like maybe the Platinum quality - gram for gram - is technically a little better. But I'm not going to worry about that since I'll never be able to figure it out. I really don't think trying one for a while and then the other is going to prove that - they probably aren't THAT much different. Someone else can do the math, but I bet you could use close to twice as much Whey Gold as Platinum for the same price per gram of protein. So use a little less than twice as much, and you'll be saving money and getting more protein.If money is no object, the Platinum could be the superior product. MAYBE you can take less or the same amount and get better results. It definitely tastes good. But I'll just stick with the Whey Gold which I know works and I'm SURE is the better value.",Flavor Name: Turbo Chocolate,the United States,2011-04-01

I always use reduced fat milk when preparing this product so I don’t know how well it works with water.Flavor: has a malt-like chocolate flavor that seems like it’s going to have a nasty aftertaste but thankfully doesn’t. It doesn’t have that delicious MuscleMilk level of flavor but it’s also a lot more healthy. Overall it’s a good, easy-to-drink chocolate flavor that isn’t very sweet.Texture: mixes easily but a spoon will leave a few sticky clumps floating around. To be honest it mixes well enough that I’m willing to deal with the minor clumping to avoid having to clean a blender or shaker bottle. Not too thick which is a good thing.Performance: obviously an opinion, but I feel a bit less sore the next day than I otherwise would’ve been had I not drank this after my workout. It works.Price: it’s more expensive than normal whey powder but the increased cost is expected with hydrolyzed whey as it’s a premium product. There are more and less expensive products on the market but I think you will have to spend significantly more to get a marginally better quality product so it’s priced just right IMO.

Well after killing 40 pounds of Now Foods, I wanted to try something new and didn't want chocolate or vanilla. I went with the strawberry Hydro Whey by ON. I'm not a big fan of ON because they use Maltodextrin and artificials that cause health problems and weight gain in the gut.I have to say, for a protein that has artificials in it, this is pretty good. I love the taste, it mixes very very easy with a blender ball cup and the taste of the strawberry literally tasted like strawberry. It is really sweet, so if you like sweet things, this is easy to down within seconds. I normally chug it because it tastes that great.To say for performance wise, after I drink this, I feel good but I sometimes feel that crash or lazy feeling you get from the additive crap in it.If ON would take out their artificial ingredient and just let it be, I would stick with it. but I have to say, this is a great protein overall if you don't believe in the artificial ingredients affecting your body.

I've tried a few different brands, both in powders and premixed shakes. I had gastric sleeve surgery almost a year ago so protein is a very important aspect of my diet. My biggest problem is flavor! I can't stand a lot of the products I've tried, it's either gritty or tastes awful, or usually, it's both. That being said, this powder is acceptable to me. It's not absolutely gag worthy but it's definitely not delicious either. It almost has an oat taste to it, which is odd but not really gross or tasty either. The protein in it is good quality and I can tell because it doesn't cause gas or bloating. My favorite is still Premier Protein shakes in chocolate but this one is good for after my workouts or if I'm really low on protein for the day. I mix it with fairlife milk, in a cup with a whisk and it blends fairly well. Please don't buy into the myth that your body can only absorb so much protein at once either because it simply isn't true. I'll still continue to look for a shake that tastes good without a ton of carbs but at this point at least I've found something tolerable. That in and of itself has been a challenge!

As of 06/12/18 the DBC flavor tastes roughly like burnt brownie flavored cardboard. Thing is, I understand without a SUPER sweetener, it can be difficult to achieve flavor, but be forewarned, it is AWFUL tasting. Consistency remains almost the same as whatever liquid you have mixed it into (adds no extra thickness). I tried both water and milk.On the positive front, it is jam packed with goodies with every scoop. It mixes extremely well (I use milk mainly) and when mixed with other powders, it continued to mix well (I add extra probiotics and stuff for my joints).I let it sit for a few hours on the counter, everything settled and needed a slight jostle, but (aside from being warm) mixed right back up and tasted exactly the same with the same consistency, which is great as I have had powders that turn to sludge if you let it sit for too long.",Flavor Name: Turbo Chocolate,the United States,2020-07-04

Tiring of looking like I rinsed my mouth with coffee eight times a day, I thought I would try the vanilla. Unfortunately, while it works as good as the chocolate, the vanilla flavor does not dissolve near as well as the chocolate, and the taste is absolutely terrible -- I mean, like ""aminos-terrible"".

It’s actually better than Gold and it’s better mixed with water rather than milk. Coz it gets coagulated for some reason with milk and I know a lot of folks said the mixability is great and that Holds good only if you mix it with water so avoid milk and it tastes great. It does feel kinda full after I have the shake unlike with the Gold one. But you know what’s the best positive I do feel a difference in recovery time after heavy and intensive workouts. I think I have less body strains and my body feels refreshed the next day and I remember the ON Gold one never gave me such an instant impact.

After purchasing this shake, I can gladly say I've found it!Being extremely lactose intolerant, I often tend to get sick from things that taste like milk, even though the lactose content is minimal. This shake has a strong milk taste, which is the only negative thing about it. But, I decided not to mark it down as all protein shakes have a strong milk taste, and because you can easily go around the milk taste by mixing it with Gatorade powder or crystal light on the go packs (sugar-free). Without mixing it with something else, however, I can't drink it. If you do not like a milk taste, then I'd recommend you get the Strawberry flavor as you can easily mix it with out flavors... not so much with the Chocolate or Vanilla flavor.The best thing about this shake is that it really doesn't contain any lactose (other's say they contain zero grams, but still contain milligrams), and it does not upset my stomach. I sometimes feel a bit bloated, but it doesn't last very long as the hydro whey is quickly digested.As far as the results go, I am already starting to see result after just a few days. As far as the preparing goes, you really don't need to blend it, you can simply stir your shake and it'll be fine as well.My ratings:Taste: 2/5 (This is obviously subjective, others who love milkshakes will love it)Mixing: 5/5 (Stirring or blending works fine)Digestion: 5/5 (Quickly digested, perfect for people with lactose intolerance)Results: 5/5 (You'll notice results after a few days)Price: 4/5 (It's a bit more expensive than other shakes, but it's definitely worth the money)",Flavor Name: Turbo Chocolate,the United States,2011-08-30

I chose this protein powder. This was instrumental for me to successfully get into the habit of exercising.For me, working out is not always enjoyable, but drinking chocolate milk always is. So I decided that I would drink chocolate protein milk ONLY after a workout. After I perfected my recipe, I came to crave the chocolate milk so much that I would work out in order to drink it. If I didn't work hard enough, i'd deny myself the privilege of drinking chocolate milk and revert to less appealing protein sources. This encouraged me to work harder and longer to get my reward. The gratification was insane.The reward method helped me get into incredible shape and achieve my dream body. I unfortunately became extremely ill and lost a lot of weight. I was emaciated, meaning I had to focus on gaining weight and not exercise for months. I am now within a healthier weight range and am working out again. Unfortunately, I got a different whey protein on a whim and it's frankly quite disgusting so I'm finding it harder to get back in the habit. Since I used reward as a motivation to achieving results and my reward right now isn't good, I'm grudgingly finishing up that tub of protein so that I can open up my new tub of tera's and return to the proper reward system.This protein is more expensive than other wheys but the ingredients (whey concentrate, organic cocoa, organic stevia, and sunflower lecithin) are much less offensive than what other protein powders have. The whey comes from family farms with artificial hormone free, grass-fed cows. Whey is then extracted from the cheesemaking process by artisan cheesemakers. (Paraphrased from the tera's whey website) Additionally, whey concentrate is superior to whey isolate, which is whey concentrate that has been stripped of its other beneficial nutrients. Other protein powders are not likely to have even a few organic ingredients. Given the cleaner sources of the ingredients and the incredible flavor, this is a guiltless source of protein. $20 is a fine price to pay for your fitness if it consistently motivates you to work even harder.Lastly, my recipe.

An animal-lover, rescuer, and conscious consumer, this was horrifying to me, and I immersed myself in finding local ranchers whose methods and product I could support. I'm super particular, but it saved my life. So getting enough protein has always been a huge issue for me and a nutritionist I really respect suggested this. I researched the crap out of it, I contacted the company, they were friendly and transparent and responsive. I tried the organic goat whey plain, and I'm obsessed. I add it to everything, particularly yogurt, and the added protein had made a tremendous overall impact in the food choices I make all day because it's more filling. My roommate rolls his eyes at most anything I consume but I got him this chocolate one and he was instantly hooked. Suddenly this mid-west farm boy who grew up on cream was making delicious pudding with almond milk and this chocolate whey powder. He won't admit it to me (!) but I notice the container is very low and I discreetly replaced it for him. It now goes into smoothies, homemade ice cream, everything. It is NOT cloyingly sweet. It's cocoa, not processed chocolate. It has a touch of stevia and I don't happen to like sweet drinks so for me I prefer the plain, but I did add to a yogurt / chia seed ""pudding"" one night meant for breakfast and it was a damn fine dessert.

I've tried just about all of them.  It doesn't help that some of those products will try and trick people by making their serving size 2 or even 3 scoops.  What I look for in a good protein powder is something provides a very high-percentage of protein with no extra fluff that might interfere with my normal diet and vitamin supplements.  And, no digestive side-effects are a huge plus, of course.Pros:- High protein content per serving (30g per scoop; each scoop is 39g, so you're looking at 77% protein by mass)- Very low sugar and carbs (only 1g and 3g per serving, respectively)- Low on vitamins, which allows me to take vitamin supplements without worrying about getting too much calcium, for example- No digestive side-effects; I can consume 120g of this per day and not experience the usual bloat you get from other protein powders- Tastes great mixed with just milkCons:- Price is moderately high, but it's not the most expensive out thereMy routine is to mix this with flax milk in a Blender bottle.

I do know that this product is expensive but as other people have said, if you have the money for it, buy it. If you want to do your own research, just google hydrolyzed whey isolates or even go to the optimum nutrition website which is quite user friendly, just don't buy from there since the price will be almost double the amount.I've also searched on other websites and amazon by far has the cheapest prices for this protein anywhere. [...] The chocolate one also taste like chocolate milk when I mix it with soy milk(since i'm lactose intolerant). It's really the best and I can't reiterate it enough. I do know that some people have sensitive stomachs when it comes to supplements so if you weary about getting this, either try it from a friend who might have it or buy the smaller containers (i think they're 1 or 2 pounds and their around 20 bucks I think) instead of this 3.5 pound bottle.

Previously with ON Gold, I used to end up feeling stuffy but not with this. I am ready to have dinner with 15 mins of having it.This is an expensive protein but I am willing to pay the extra $$ for the above two qualities alone. As far as results go, I haven't seen any noticeable difference in muscle mass having Platinum vs Gold. I believe the Gold works as well as Platinum. Also the platinum scoop is bigger, so I guess the proteins/gram averages out. I hate when ON says you get more protein/g with Platinum when the fact is they increased the scoop size.

I consume all different types of bone broths anywhere from 1-3 times per day. I suffer from early onset osteo arthritis due to hypermobility EDS. Bone broths help my joint pain, and help me manage my weight, which is also very important with both health issues. I am only 41 years old and have young kids, so I need my body to function properly for a long time to come. I have made a list of pros and cons from my experience with bone broth and this product.Pros:1.) Chocolate and Salted Caramel both taste great to me. The chocolate does have a chocolate coconut flavor, so if that is not your thing, it is important to know.2.) It is low calorie and keeps you feeling full.3.) Great for gut health.4.) Great for connective tissue and skin health.5.) A great (and sweet) alternative to savory bone broth.6.) More versatile that savory bone broth. You can drink it hot, cold, with coffee, in a smoothie, etc.Cons:1.) No very easy to mix. Not sure I could use this on the go, and be as happy with it. I generally pulse it in the blender and it comes out frothy and good. People say varying things about this. I like the product to be well incorporated - no lumps. I mix it with hot water most of the time. I do the same thing, whether I use it cold or hot.2.) The price is high for the amount of servings. That being said, I think it is worth it to use once a day. The quality of the product is on point.I recommend this product for people looking for something different than the typically savory bone broth. This product is more versatile than traditional bone broths.

I never write reviews but I must post this everywhere this product is being advertised and sold. I was so excited to try this product, as making bone broth is time-consuming and this seemed to be exactly what I needed. I should have known from the horrible customer service this company has that things are not right here, It is very disheartening as Dr. Axe claims to be so natural and also spiritual. All I can say is that shortly after beginning this bone broth, my gut started hurting more and more, something I had never experienced in my life. Since I trusted the quality of this product I was convinced it was something else. Well, it got to the point that shortly after consuming this, whether in shakes or water, I was screaming in pain from my gut. It felt like it was ripping open and about to bleed out everywhere. Still not believing it could be this product, and that he would allow something so dangerous to be consumed by so many, I continued to take it. I even made vegetable broth and added the powder to it. It was then that I knew something was probably very very wrong, as it turned rock solid hard. In fact, it was so solidified on the spoon I used I had to take a picture as proof. Imagine this rock scraping the lining of your gut- a product that is intended to heal. After a month of progressive pain, I finally could not handle it anymore and was scared I was dying. I ended up in the ER for three days! I am 30 years old. I was pumped up on morphine which only made the pain worse, and the nurses and doctors said I was ""not normal"" and had no idea what to do. I ended up getting a colonoscopy and endoscopy. The colonoscopy showed thickening of the walls in my small intestine and also much inflammation. I was then released as they did not know what to do. I immediately stopped this product upon arriving home as I had eliminated every other possibility, I am slowly on my way to healing and getting better each day, but Dr. Axe's Bone Broth protein severely hurt me, and also cost large amounts of money in sending me to the hospital and all the exams and tests that were run. I am still in pain, but within two days of stopping this I instantly began to get better. There has got to be something, if not more than one thing in this product that is unsafe for consumption or just really bad for the human body. I am just writing this to warn people. You can try it for yourself, but to be honest I would suggest saving your money. Or become a customer of a company who is A. honest and B. Has quality customer service. I do not feel this company is doing things right. I just hope to bring about some awareness by just sharing my experience with this new product, and maybe preventing this from happening to others.

My daughter has suffered many years with extreme fatigue, brain fog and pain that came without reason.  By without reason, I mean she had not done anything to hurt her body but if it wasn't her neck or back, it was her achilles tendons or calf muscle.  She has taken many products over the years but never found relief.  She started the Bone Broth and added the 6 Collagen Peptide product after a short period.  She is so excited because she can now ""think""; brain fog gone.  She has energy and can even exercise again.  Thank you God.A friend was bi-polar, hurting to the point of tears and experiencing neuropathy.  The doctors could not pinpoint her problem as she had already had carpal tunnel surgery but her pain was unbearable; their solution pain killers.  I suggested she take the Bone Broth and gave her a Shaklee vitamin strip as I knew she did not eat good.  Within 3 days her pain started to ease off until it was 90% better.  She claimed it was a ""miracle"".My husband has many complex issues: candida overgrowth, leaky gut, severe allergies(food, mold & chemical) and most recently had the debilitating muscle issues from taking a quinolone drug called Levaquin(he as floxed).  When he started the Bone Broth he felt like his brain ""woke up"".  He had more energy and felt good. Progress!  He continued to take the Bone Broth and added Ancestrial Supplements of Beef Organs, Spleen, Thymus and finally Bone Marrow.  His sharpe pains in his muscles and cramps at night have stopped.  I hope this helps someone who has issues with long term side effects of antibiotics.My I say the common denominator her is the Bone Broth.  Most of us have leaky gut and don't realize that is a good part of the health picture.  I don't believe it is the answer by itself to all problems but I do believe if you fix the leaky gut, a little good nutrition can go a long way.  My husband and I both are 73: I take no medicine and he takes blood pressure.  He was taking Zyrtec, Day Quil and using inhalers just to be able to make it through the day, every day.  He no longer has to do that.  We have gone the nutrition route for over 40 years and have learned much by trial and error.

(I am medical vegan, not a moral one, and I didn't use fur, leather, or honey for a long time before doctor ordered me onto diet so I do consider self more vegan than not). It may turn a burnt taste, if you take this with 2 teaspoons or more apple cider vinegar in a 20-24 oz preparation, that kills the burnt after taste well. I do not do fruit smoothies because of blood sugar issues, so cold dissolve/mix I have no experience in. This does provide a nice amount of protein per serving. I am seeing some improvements in joint pain (borderline plaque psoriasis) and related, and my paper thin razor fingernails and paper/laminated toenails (lifetime) plus hair (split ends on split ends on split ends) by going to roughly one serving a day on this item. Will recommend as it will provide one equivalent serving of hard protein (23-25g for a 4 oz lean beef buger) to someone's daily diet, if you're willing to ingest hard (animal derived) protein. This is in the realm of Kosher for a protein source (gelatin on steroids, not the drug just a comment) and easy to digest. I do look for more vegetarian sources for my protein, but can state: This is TRUELY gluten free-if you are celiac this is NOT made in a facility that also processes wheat. I have proof in growing out finger and toe nails, plus hair, that this will help you. I have proven improvements in joint issues that will help you. I will totally say this is worth the $40 a container price as a dietary AID.

I did not get my hopes up as so many products make their standard empty promises. Within a week though I noticed a difference in joint mobility and stomach problems that plague me. In fact, this week I have for the first time since I can’t even remember when found myself cooking an entire meal without needing to take breaks and eating without feeling sick.Now, let me address what many others have mentioned regarding the taste. I have honestly never in my life given a thought to what roadkill in the summer on a hot August day on a southern highway would smell and taste like. However, now I believe myself knowledgeable after drinking this. After the first swig of my vile creation there was no way I was going to make it past another chug. I had tried it in milk attempting to mask the flavor. vanilla will not even phase it. My lightbulb went off as I detected the slightest hint of a coffee taste giving me the idea to add some hazelnut creamer I had in fridge. So this trick of mixing it milk and coffee creamer might work for some of you. I also mix it with a spoon and since it has clumps I take a few out at a time drinking that with the milk and creamer making the clumps taste not as bad.",Flavor Name: Pure,the United States,2021-05-30

Before using this miracle power (this is my opinion), I could not walk up one flight of stairs (six steps) without stopping, and breathing slowly, now I can walk up the same flight of stairs and more, and walk over three miles or more.

The second noticeable change that people noticed is my skin; they are saying that it is glowing and the skin look even tone. Some people are saying I do not look sixty-five years old.

However, I am a vegetarian (unless I see bacon, in which case all bets are off) and so getting sufficient protein without increasing calories to levels unacceptable to me has proven difficult.  I vaccinate between angrily grumbling about know it all doctors and just giving up on eating more protein, or gaining weight trying to force my diet to provide  complete proteins - lots of beans and rice and tofu and, come on, none of that stuff is edible unless it has lots of fat and a pretty fair amount of salt.I don’t know where the idea of protein powder entered my head because protein powders are not the sort of thing I had ever really been aware of, and if I had been aware of protein powders I would have wondered who the hell would use them.  Like, why?  Why eat powder, unless it’s the powder on a donut (did I mention I have a sweet tooth?).  What a strange thing to do.  But you know the internet, and how it takes you to places you never expected to go, whether you like it or not.  One day I somehow ended up on a site comparing protein powders.  I read, fascinated, and kind of grossed out about gritty smoothies and lumpy shakes.  About faint whiffs of horrible smells and terrible tastes (no matter how much reviews try to make you believe something tastes acceptable, I can always detect a big hint of ambivalence, a sort of shirking of recognition of the truth - phrases like “you can barely taste it” and “it was almost like my regular coffee only with a different taste” or “I gulp it down like medicine and feel good about it” or “it’s barely gritty at all if you use a high speed blender” or my favorite, “the globules of undissolved powder are not too slimy and it pretty much does taste like chocolate” give the game away.After reading enough reviews of different powders to make my head spin, and finally even taking notes, I realized there was a pattern - one brand of protein powder was lauded for more than its protein and other things that I have not a clue about (MCTs?, BCAAs?).  This one brand of protein powder was actually lauded for taste, no matter mostly people talked about the salted caramel flavor, the idea of which makes me want to barf, their rhapsodic descriptions of deliciousness and the overall apparent  agreement that this powder had all the acronyms generally agreed to be necessary along with a gold standard amount of protein made me decide to order it.  I just hoped salted caramel was not the only flavor.Not to keep you in suspense, because, here I am reviewing Quest Vanilla Milkshake Powder, the powder brand I decided to try was indeed, Quest.  It arrived in a big ass tub and the instructions printed on the side talked about it’s scoop, which I though I had forgotten to buy - but no, it’s scoop does come with it, it was just hiding, lodged firmly down at the very bottom of the powder, goodly quantities of which were sadly lost In a powder cloud that arose during my excavations.When talking about protein powder, just about everyone said, don’t try this with just a spoon and a glass or you’ll be horribly sorry, so I had purchased a plastic cup with a sort of odd plastic weathervane attached to the bottom and surprisingly, a USB cord - It really IS the future when even your cup needs to be charged, though I’m surprised it didn’t come internet ready.  Next iteration.  Nearly everyone also said don’t try this with water - get some some milk, even nut milk If that’s all you can find, or coffee, or something else to disguise the powder in.  But I decided to just jump in the deep end with this and so once my cup was charged and emitting an eerie green light, I added 8 ounces of water, pushed the button on the cup, which created a sort of negative tornado, and added a scoop of the powder, which got just consumed by the tornado, and let it twirl for 5 seconds as the cup had indicated.  With trepidation I poured the resulting creamy, foamy looking mixture into a glass in which I had added several cubes of ice and took a sip.  OMG, OMG, OMG!  It was not just acceptable - it was downright delicious.  Slightly creamy, softly vanilla-esque, with a gentle sweetness that was fabulous to the bottom of the glass.  No grittiness, no powder in my mouth, and certainly no globules, slimy or otherwise marred the drink.  I actually clobbered my nose with the ice cubes trying to suck out the last drops of its goodness.  So no, it doesn’t need anything but water, and possibly a cup with a USB cable to be wonderful (don’t tell anyone, but I might even add a shot of rum and maybe a slice of pineapple once in a while because I think it might make a killer pina colada type deal.)  I have no doubt that I will enjoy the tub of Quest to the last scoop and I think I will get on a delivery schedule for it.  Just wait till my doctor finds out I actually listened to her.",Style: Vanilla Milkshake,the United States,2020-09-26

Doesn't include a scoop,"This is probably the best tasting protein powder I've had (before this, I only got a local store brand) and it does taste good. Very much like salted caramel, no real complaints about the flavor. Which isn't surprising, it's my first time trying Quest protein powder, but their other products are very consistent.It is also VERY fine, whereas the other protein powders I've had were kind of clumpy, like you'd need to run them through a siv. This one was smooth, didn't clump, it's easy to make it into a spread or incorporate into yogurt for example. I bet this would also be excellent for popcorn seasoning.My two complaints are that it's expensive and there doesn't seem to be a scoop. Now, maybe there is and it's just buried in there, though I already digged around. But I think it's really inconvenient to have to put my arm in a protein powder especially when as I mentioned, it's very fine and will stick/cling to you and whatever else it may touch.It's especially inconvenient because this protein powder is EXPENSIVE. My store brand is maybe $14 for a 14 ounce container. Maybe not actually that much cheaper, but mind you, there is no option to buy a smaller size here to sample flavors. And I have to pay shipping or buy enough on Amazon that it's free. Plus Quest is a popular brand, I expect better quality control.So not including a scoop is a problem in my eyes. Without a scoop, that ""1 scoop is 26 grams of protein"" suddenly means nothing. That's probably a big deal to you reading this, because if you're buying protein powder, I bet you're trying to get a certain amount. No scoop makes that much harder.A REALLY simple solution to this would be if Quest made a string attached to the scoop, or alternatively just shipped a scoop outside of the package to be included in the same box it's delivered in.",Style: Salted Caramel,the United States,2023-07-03

Once the thick mix is ready, I throw it in the waffle iron. Usually, I will add a spoon full of almond butter for a little extra flavor. But no need to add sugar because this protein shake is already perfectly sweetened. I usually adjust the thickness with the amount of water or oat milk I add.

Anyway....What I will say is that this is a very fine, light powder that mixes better than other, higher priced proteins I've tried, which means that it mixes much easier into water or milk. It also tastes decidedly less chalky and grainy than others I'm used to. I usually just make what basically amounts to protein-chocolate milk with it, and it actually tastes good (not just tolerable).Another high point that some other powders just can't really do very well at all is that it is very good for cooking.

It mixes well in a shaker bottle, using just water. The label recommends using 8 oz (0.3 kg) of water for a milkshake type drink.  Since I use a 20 oz (0.76 kg) shaker bottle and fill it up, I add a few tablespoons of heavy cream to give it a creamier taste.  I've also mixed it with half water and half plant based milk (like coconut, almond, etc.) for a little extra nutrition.Depending on the flavor, you get 20-26 g of protein, about 20% of the daily recommended amount of calcium, and from 100 up to 120 calories.  All the flavors are 2 net grams of carbs and sweetened with erythritol, sucralose and stevia, no added sugars. The Cookies and Cream and Cinnamon Crunch flavors have ""cookie crumbs"" like you would find in those flavors of ice cream, so don't be put off by the fact that there are crumbs in your drink.

Out of the many I had tried for years, I finally had settled on ON Whey Gold and it was OK, but I didn't love it and so I didn't drink it as much as I should have when working out. Also, it did cause gas issues, a common side affect of many protein shakes, and also the aftertaste wasn't bad, but nothing to be happy about either. The price was great on it as well, and so I just settled on it.Finally, after reading reviews about Syntha-6 online and having friends tell me about it, I gave it a shot and it is AMAZING!!!!! I only drink chocolate flavored protein shakes and this one is creamy and rich and so delicious that it doesn't even seem like you are drinking a protein shake. Also, it has 6 different kinds of protein sources, hence the name, and I like that so I get fast and slow digesting proteins at once, which is much better for overall muscle growth. In addition to that, and most important I think, is that it has digestive enzymes and also 5 grams of fiber per scoop. That helps so much in preventing bloating, gas, and even constipation. I know that may gross some people out, but for anyone drinking a few shakes a day, it is very important.The shake is a touch sweeter and I like that as well, and it is a good dessert as well. It has 22 grams of protein per scoop and mixed with 8 oz of milk, a perfect 30 gram shake that can be taken anytime during the day, or multiple times throughout the day.The cons: I wish it had more BCAA's, but from the powder form I buy of that, I know why they don't add extra in and that is because it would make it really chalky. Also, for the protein percent per scoop, it isn't as high as ON Whey or some others, but the mix of proteins compared to just straight whey is a better trade off I think.Pro and Con: The cost is a bit more to a lot more depending on sales and per scoop right now without any sales or coupons or other promos, it about a $1 per scoop where I could get ON Whey at about $0.50 per scoop. So yes, double the price, but when you realize that this is something much more enjoyable and that taste is just as important, than it justifies the cost. At best I could do 2-3 scoops of ON Whey Gold per day for a few weeks, but with this, I easily do double scoops after workouts and before bed, and another scoop upon waking and another as a snack, so about 6 scoops a day without ever getting tired of it. That is 180 grams of protein, plus 30 grams of fiber. I usually don't get that much fiber from my mostly meat diet otherwise, and as someone trying to get 250-300 grams of protein a day, this has helped out so much.Even if your just looking for a shake in the morning for breakfast, this is great as it has about 200 calories and when mixed with milk and then a piece of fruit or a small granola bar or other breakfast item, it is a great 400-500 calorie meal that is better than any fast food pickup you can make.I already recommend this to so many of my friends, and I will do the same for you as well***** Bonus Points  **********I wanted to try different flavors of Syntha-6 and wanted to order trial kits of different flavors to try before buying a whole jug, and the flavors I wanted were out of stock at the time and so I emailed BSN. Within an hour, they responded, asked for my address and sent me a Cookie Dough and Chocolate Cake batter trial packet for free. They were apologetic for not having what I wanted in stock and thanked me for my business still and the two trial packets they sent were not asked for by me, yet delivered for free and I can say it is a joy to deal with great customer service.GO BSN!!!!!!!",Flavor Name: Chocolate Milkshake,the United States,2013-10-14

Great flavor, great nutrition profile, and thickens nicely. I use this as a meal replacement and a supplement. On gym mornings (and some others) I skip my usual breakfast and drink one of these shakes on my way to work. I blend with milk or water, with ice, usually a half-teaspoon of chia seeds, another half-teaspoon or so of ground flax seed just to supplement the fiber. Sometimes I blend in a tablespoon (heaping) of peanut butter (I prefer chunky). Sometimes I throw in some frozen blueberries or strawberries...yum. I don't think you can go wrong with this stuff.

The protein content is impressive, and it mixes well with both water and milk, leaving no clumps. The taste is also quite good, not overly sweet like some other protein powders I've tried.The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the size of the scoop provided. It's quite large and can be a bit difficult to maneuver in a standard shaker bottle. Also, the powder tends to settle at the bottom if not consumed immediately.However, these are minor issues and do not detract from the overall quality of the product.

Drinking a glass with milk each day reduces the amount of muscle pain and stiffness I have from the AS. Quest by far is one of the better ones I've bought and the one I will likely stick with.My review is based on using 2% milk as my mixer. I can not comment on it using water.  The consistency with milk (1 scoop = 8 oz milk), is that of a regular chocolate milk. If you want a thicker shake - something more like a milkshakes - that is possible as well by using less milk.Pros:The taste is very chocolatey so for those who are like me and have a heavy sweet tooth, it will work well. However, if you are not wanting something that tastes like a true chocolate milk, it will likely be too much for you. It is a VERY sweet taste. If you've ever had Thrive by Le-Vel chocolate, the taste is comparable.The price point is pretty decent compared to some others. The only thing that has ever worked for what I use it for better is Thrive by Le-Vel. At $44 for 2 weeks of Le-Vel, the Quest provides comparable results at half the cost.Container size is great. It's a fairly decent sized container for the price you pay.Cons:You absolutely need a shaker ball to add to whatever you're mixing in. A personal blender would be better. It does tend to clump w/out a shaker ball.All in all, it's well worth it for me and since it does do what I need it to do, isn't causing me to go broke and tastes great as a bonus, I'll keep using it.",Style: Chocolate Milkshake,the United States,2020-12-22

Vanilla Ice Cream flavor,"Well, I've been trying out various protein powders this year, for trying to lose weight, not for working out.As I type this, I have six different brands in house in various flavors.  Syntha-6 beats them all on the flavor.I try the mixes with milk, but judge them on how I normally drink them, which is with cold water.(Milk and I don't agree very much, so I have to limit my milk intake drastically.)So far, I've only tried the Syntha-6 in the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. I read through almost all the reviews before purchasing,and looked up more on the actual contents of the product on another site. (This is a downfall of Amazon's - they don't provide enough information on the ingredients for food products! To list foods, I wish they'd require at minimum that the Nutrition Facts label contents be posted!Anyway, I must say that this powder has fantastic flavor, both with water and with milk. It is higher in calories than some of the other brands out there, but has more protein. One of the reasons I tried it (and the reason I rule out many other brands/flavors) is that this has NO ASPARTAME. I am allergic to it, and must watch all foods and supplements carefully for it being snuck in to the mixes. This does have some corn syrup in it, which is probably why it tastes so good! But, if you are someone who is avoiding corn sweeteners, then note that this item has it.It tastes a lot like a bowl of good vanilla ice cream that melted would taste. Yes, it is that creamy and tasty.My only real complaint about this item is that it makes a very thin-bodied shake. It is like a glass of vanilla milkin texture. If you mix it with water, it looks like really cheap skim milk. That's a bit of a put-off. I ended up mixing it half and half with a flavor of Spiru-Tein and got a decent, tasty thick shake. (Note that I really don't like Spiru-tein's vanillas - there's not much hope for them. But other flavors mix nicely with this brand's vanilla.)Now, note that I have limitations in my mixing that many others won't have. I am partially disabled, so can't always get ice when I want it, or just throw some frozen fruit into the mix. Many times, I am home alone and the kitchen is downstairs, out of my reach. I did try this with ice, and that helped A LOT. Definitely better and a tad thicker when ice cubes were added to the mix. But, I don't see why Syntha-6 doesn't add a little more of some type of thickener to the mix. It would make a world of difference in the general texture of the drink. I haven't tried adding a little guar gum myself yet, so don't know if that would help.Here is the ingredient list:A Sustained Release Ultra-Premium Protein Matrix Comprised of (Ultrafiltered Whey Protein Concentrate [Milk] Rich in Alpha-Lactalbumin, Microfiltered Whey Protein Isolate [Milk] Rich in Whey Isolate Peptide Fractions, Calcium Caseinate, Micellar Alpha and Beta Caseins and Caseinates [Milk], Milk Protein Isolate [Milk], and Egg Albumen [Egg], Glutamine Peptides), Richmix Sunflower Powder Consisting of (Sunflower Oil, Corn Syrup Solids, Sodium Caseinate [Milk], Mono- and Di-Glycerides, and Dipotassium Phosphate), Litesse II Polydextrose, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Nutrisperse MCT Powder Consisting of (Medium Chain Triglycerides, Non-Fat Dry Milk, Disodium Phosphate, and Silicon Dioxide), Ticalose Cellulose Gum, Sucralose, Acesulfame Potassium, Lecithin [Soy], Aminogen, and Papain.Overall, I really like this product. Since I started using it, my nails have been growing like crazy!  Not sure if it is related to this product, but it was certainly a change I experienced. I don't feel hungry afterwards, and it doesn't leave me with ""hairy tongue"" like some powders do.

I have lost 40 lbs, but part of my weight-training goal is to gain strength and I certainly wasn't accomplishing this goal through weight-lifting alone.  I started to research how to clean up my diet and this brought me around to searching for a protein supplement.  After finding several other protein shakes to be distasteful,  I was advised to look at Syntha-6.  After trying a sample (which is rare enough to find in a GNC) I knew I had found my protein shake.  In this month, I have noticed incredible results in strength- it's like my body was completely prepped but lacked the proper building blocks.Positives: Many, but here are some that appealed most to me.-Taste:  The strawberry milkshake is fantastic mixed with water (preferably ice cold to simulate an actual milkshake).  I have heard and often used the comparison to a McDonald's strawberry milkshake- which is quite a leap above many other protein powders.  I thought my sweet-tooth would be a huge handicap in achieving my fitness goals, but this protein shake really feels like I am treating myself after every workout.  My 20 oz shaker bottle is usually empty by the time I am leaving the gym parking lot.-The nutritional value in a double serving can serve as a quick meal on-the-go (although I am currently at 6 small meals a day, one of these is usually a protein shake and possibly something small).-Going from a protein bar to Muscle Milk, I found a slight decrease in my recovery time.  My first run with Syntha-6, I completed a brutal leg workout that I thought would have me wincing at the mere sight of the stairs in my house the next day.  Although I still felt the work-out, I was able to complete my second day of training with some cardio thrown in without issue.  Syntha-6 has not let me down yet for improving recovery time.-This was the perfect price for me.  After searching other stores (bodybuilding.com, GNC, etc.) I found Amazon to have the best price and with free shipping it was a no-brainer.  To give a good idea, using 4 servings daily (early day and post-workout) the 5.04 lb lasted just over a month (roughly 5 weeks).  Time to get more!Negatives: The few and far between.-Mixability.  I will be the first to admit that this is a rough shake to mix up.  With a spoon and a glass it is nearly impossible.  I had success with a blender, but I didn't really want to bring a portable electronic blender to the gym.  This was a very quick fix however, as I got a blender bottle (recommended to purchase on Amazon or Wal-Mart) with the little wire ball and... Boom.  Mixes great, although if the bottle is damp (recently washed) the powder has a tendency to absorb the droplets and congeal to those spots and sometimes mixing those out can be tough.-What to mix with?  I recommend ice-cold water, but I did try it with both regular and soy milk.  I was REALLY hoping the taste would come through in the soy milk, as it has greater nutritional value than regular milk.  That was the only time I had to choke down a syntha-6 shake.  In regular milk, it tastes similar to the Nesquik strawberry milk.-Scoop size.  I know this is dumb, but the scoop is considerably large.  I am going to estimate it to be about 3/4 of a cup (more or less?).  I think this is part of the problem that people have with mixing it up.  It suggests 8 oz of water per scoop and I have to dilute it a bit more than that... But this also helps get in my daily quota of H2O.Would I recommend this?  Definitely.",Flavor Name: Strawberry Milkshake,the United States,2012-09-07

Contains sunflower lecithin (a plus). Mixes well with liquids.,"I just bought this product, and these are my initial comments:What I like:1) It tastes good2) It mixes well (or reasonably well), even in cold beverages.  (It doesn't dissolve as completely, for example, as sugar dissolves in water, but close.) (It reminds me of the way a little cocoa powder will sometimes float when making cocoa.) (It does dissolve much better than the Coconut oil powder put out by the same company.)3) I felt more alert after taking it, and was surprised, a few minutes after drinking a glass of raw milk with this product mixed into it, that my vision seemed unusually ""bright"" and clear - an effect from the ketones, I expect - but an effect I had not expected, and have not gotten when taking ketones in liquid oil form. So in that sense I like it better than liquid MCT oil.4) I like its portability - it's easy to pack a scoop or two to have with lunch5) It's great that it contains sunflower lecithin. Some reviewers have complained about this, but I don't know what they're complaining about. Sunflower lecithin is non-GMO. Most people consider the kind made from sunflowers safer and better for the body than the lecithin made from soy.  Lecithin has many benefits, including being rich in phosphatidyl serine.  If you want a product to mix well in liquids, some kind of lecithin is probably necessary. So, kudos to the company for choosing this type.6) Lastly, this isn't specific to this product, but it's great to live in a day and age in which sources of exogenous ketones, like this one, are so readily available.RESERATIONSI understand that they need to mix some fiber in; but I'm not sure why they chose corn fiber. I'd be happier if it wasn't in there (or if they could at least guarantee that it was from non-GMO corn). But since fiber passes through the gut unabsorbed, by and large, I'm not too concerned about it. It's a minor issue, not a deal breaker by any means.RECOMMENDATIONSMCT oil products can sometimes upset the stomach, when you start taking them. If you're new to taking MCT oil, start with less than a scoop, and build up. If you're used to taking MCT in other forms (such as liquified oils), I doubt that taking this would bother your digestion.",Style: MCT Oil Powder,the United States,2017-01-19

One thing you can be sure of is you’re receiving the best ingredients with whatever your choice. There are tons of recipes available online for different drinks and baking recipes.I’m addicted to the Caramel Protein powder and it’s been my go to for well over a year now. Generally I mix it in my morning smoothie using 8 ounces of a favorite almond/coconut milk a few ice cubes and it fuels my body, keeping me satisfied well into the afternoon. Another option I enjoy is replacing the milk with cold brewed coffee. Either way you’re in for a treat! A taste that easily compares to your favorite milkshake. The options are endless, whether to choose to drink or bake with it.For me personally I feel using a blender makes it extra tasty with a thick texture. Especially with about a cup or so of ice cubes. I’ve heard of others hand mixing it but I don’t know if I’d enjoy as much that way.So with that said, I highly recommend Quest Protein Shakes.

It's not top of the line, but you're not getting garbage either.On to the Syntha-6 specifically: taste is top notch and hard to beat. Ace-K as a sweetener, along with the other fillers, aren't great for you, but they're in almost all other major brands so it's hard to avoid. The additional 10g BCAAs are a nice touch, however, you don't know which amino acids they're packaging and at what doses - is it effective???Unless you go to higher end brands, you're going to get proprietary blends and you won't know the dose of each ingredient. That's just something you have to be willing to accept in this tier of supplements.Having a protein blend is great as research suggests that when you add medium-digesting (egg) and slow-digesting (casein) proteins to fast-digesting whey, muscle protein synthesis remains elevated for longer and muscle protein retention is higher. Not many recovery shakes have a protein blend, especially at this price point. Downside to Syntha-6, we don't know how much of each protein source there is.The sodium and carbs are a little high. This makes the nutrition profile more like a meal replacement than a lean protein source.Biggest question is does it work? I would say yes, it outperforms many of the protein shakes at this price point.Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

I recently got the chocolate mint flavor for myself and the vanilla ice cream flavor for my husband (since he doesn't like chocolate mint or mint anything), and have used it for about a week now.Until a week ago, I was using the Elite XT powder from Vitamin Shoppe, but I will never go back to it- Syntha-6 is really that awesome!  It's got a great taste- even the vanilla flavor, and I usually don't like ANY vanilla protein powders because they give me heartburn for some reason.  Not this one!  The quality of this stuff is amazing, and it's really filling.  I haven't tried it with water yet (I'm traumatized my using Muscle Milk with water... aka dissolved chalk in a cup, eew), so I use the unsweetened plain 40 calorie almond milk with it (Almond Breeze, I think).  The flavor is really smooth, and has that ever-so-slight dairy, milkshake kind of aftertaste without actually having to use ANY milk products (except the protein, of course).  I don't like milk at all, and was allergic when I was younger but I'm not anymore.  I've always drank Soy and used tofu, and then in recent years since it's become more widely produced, almond and coconut milks; I can't stand the taste of cow milk- yogurt, some ice cream, and cheese is as far as my dairy consumption goes.  Even still, if I have too much lactose my nose gets stuffy and all that fun stuff.  My husband has become more sensitive to lactose in the last 2 or so years, too, so this protein powder is really nice for that, even though it is whey; there's no bloating, no upset stomach, and is really tolerable if you're sensitive to lactose (I actually didn't even know it was until I read the whole label yesterday, it's that good).That being said, after using it for about a week, I love it!  It really does keep you absolutely stuffed until your next meal 3 hrs later.  My husband agrees; with the Elite XT he would have to add extra fruit or almond/peanut butter to his protein shakes to stay fuller longer, but hasn't added anything to any of his shakes made with the Syntha-6 powder, which is amazing.  It has an awesome flavor with no nasty chalk or salty aftertaste, and is really nice after a hard workout- it really does reduce your soreness and decreases recovery time.  I can't say too much about fat loss benefits yet, but I imagine with how filling it is, and how well the body responds to it after a workout it would be pretty effective in helping.  Only time will tell, but so far, so good!  I don't think I'll ever buy another brand of protein powder, I'm an addict already.(The only reason I give it 4 stars is just because I haven't had it long enough to evaluate its benefit toward fat loss, but I'm sure it will be changing to 5 stars...)",Flavor Name: Vanilla Ice Cream,the United States,2012-01-14

Not financially, but physically. This powder has an extremely long ingredient list and the reason the scoop is so big is because it is full of fillers. It is a trash product that sells well because of nice packaging, successful advertising, and the fact that BSN is a popular ""name brand"".

I would argue that the protein content of this product is not absorbed by the body at all. It digests very poorly. Once switching to a more pure protein source, I realized how many symptoms of inefficient digestion I was having while taking this product. A training partner of mina also experienced increases in acne while using this protein that cleared up instantly when he switched brands.Due to the stress on the digestive system and the low quality of this product, I believe that I was actually doing more harm to my physique and performance than good while taking this product. These sweeteners and fats are the exact ingredients that make the ""standard American"" diet. I highly recommend not supporting this company. They are in it for the money, not to produce quality affordable products for serious athletes. You are better off buying a more pure protein source or just eating real food. Like I said before, I wish I could have gone back to years ago and never purchased my first bag of this powder. Don't let that great taste fool you. Honestly, do not waste money on a business that isn't dedicated to performance as their number one goal. They are in it to make a buck, not to make you stronger!",Flavor Name: Chocolate Milkshake,the United States,2023-09-02

I am obese and I trying to get my health/weight/stress levels under control.I (very reluctantly) decided that my first round of behavior modification would include getting my digestive system under control by trying to regulate my diet, adding a significant amount of fiber and protein. I was very wary of getting a protein powder because I don't like gritty textures and don't tolerate ""healthy"" tasting items well either. I once threw up a Muscle Milk.But this stuff tastes AMAZING.  I actually LIKE it and you couldn't pay me to say that before.  It's the fat person's protein powder. The con to that is that you cannot mix it without a blender. I mean not at ALL. It all clumps up on top. It's also near impossible to get it smooth in a Blender Bottle, so it's not so convenient if your on the go.  I haven't blended in advance, so I can't tell you if it settles or maintains it's flavor that way. If I do, I will update the review.It also packs a calorie punch. Its about 200 calories a scoop, two servings with 1 & half cup almond milk will put you a whopping 640 calories. I am just using it for protein supplementation and it's heavy on the calorie count.  It's also 23% (per SCOOP) of your daily cholesterol intake. I already have high cholesterol, so I am leery about consuming 46% of my daily value just in shakes (and that's with cholesterol FREE almond milk, with regular milk it would clog your arteries). Speaking as an already obese person, it's sometimes difficult to maneuver around this 640 calorie drink and meet my 1400 goal. I use one shake as a snack and one as a meal (usually breakfast). That only leaves me 760 calories to do TWO meals. And that's just the powder, not add-ins like peanut butter or strawberries. It is possible to do this, but it takes some sacrifice and ingenuity, especially given my inherent love of food that led to my obesity.I gave it 4 stars because it does have a boatload of protein (22g per serving) if your doing in 2x per day, and are heavy like myself, it's so worth it. Also, because you can't BEAT the taste and it has 6g fiber so it leaves you full for some time.

DAAAAANG!,"Please feel free to read the hundreds of other reviews on this product, as they will provide you with invaluable information. However, it good to note that this product comes with Branched-chain amino acids, Glutamine peptides, is Aspartame free and stacks with a bunch of supplements. For the record however, I am going to voice my opinion solely on flavor in contrast to MYOFUSION Vanilla flavor. To be fair, I got MYOFUSION's vanilla flavor because I read the rather decrepit reviews of the other flavors. Being a college student and investing in 5 lb tubs every month means you better LOVE the flavor that you end up picking (however to GNC's credit, they do offer a 30 day trial and return period). In all honesty, the vanilla flavor was pretty decent. MYOFUSION lacks the aforementioned BCAA's, and from what I recall, each scoop is about 36g/ serving. Its good and flavor wise beat out GNC's generic whey protein, or even Warrior whey.So I read up reviews about BSN Syntha 6 and was shocked about how many positive reviews it got; specifically the chocolate version. Needless to say once I ran out of MYOFUSION, I quickly ordered Syntha-6. I received the item today, and couldn't wait to try it out (even though today is an 'off' day for me). Based solely on flavor and taste alone, I CANNOT stress how amazing it is with just a dash of 1% skim milk (less than half a cup). I mean it truly tastes like Chocolate milk. There is a creamy like texture, but not too thick (also depends on how much fluids you add obviously).  Each heaping scoop is a mighty 44g (22g protein, 15g carbs, 2g sat fat, 2g sugars) and equates to 200 calories per! So be careful and make sure all your nutrient intake numbers play well with your goals; please read other reviews as well, and be sure to look at the product snapshot to get a gauge of the nutrients packed into this monster.I look forward to trying BSN for this whole month and seeing for any positive results when it comes to weight training. This thing is packed to the brim with nutrition and flavor; I cannot see why anyone would ignore this if you have a remote and passing interest in physical activity. For roughly $42, I can't imagine something that meets my nutrient requirements, balances cost, and doesn't skimp on the taste. AMAZING!p.s.

It obviously doesn’t have the exact texture (unless you use an ice cream maker or Ninja Creamy apparently). But the taste is a 10/10. It actually does come out creamy with a little ice and a medium blend. I used a scoop of the protein powder and a cup of extra creamy oat milk.

They really know how to market their products, and the product reviews reflect excellent results. Here are my impressions on having used Syntha-6 over the past 2 years.I moved to Brazil 3 1/2 years ago, and there, popular name brand supplement prices are insane. The price for this product there is more than double on some occasions, so it wasn't really feasible for me to keep buying it. At this price, it was a no brainer. Seeing as how i came home every year, I decided to stock up and take some with me and here are my results.I tried to intake just two shakes a day. The carb count is pretty high on these, but as I go hard in the gym, I really need that extra boost. If you take this protein, and don't work out - you will gain weight. That's not rocket science. However, like I said, burn those carbs up in the gym! That's what they're for!Compared to other proteins, I always have a big boost in the gym with this one. It is probably because this isn't just strictly protein. There are lots of good things in this for you, so don't be surprised if you notice a great improvement in energy and overall ability.The taste is awesome too! I always get any variety of chocolate, and it's a great treat throughout the day. Unlike some proteins, this protein mixes exceptionally well. No issues whatsoever.One negative I found with this is the digestibility. I'm sure this is different for different people, but I maintain a little stomach trouble with this product. Not enough to stop me from using it, but enough to be annoying. I do have a sensitive stomach though, so I'm sure it won't have the same effect on everybody as it does me.Overall I really enjoy this product. I want to try the isolate out, but it's a little pricey for me right now. Amazon has a great price on this, and after seeing how much it is in Brazil, I'm glad to know I can find it here at this great price.Go and try it for yourself! After you get the boost, you'll be glad!",Flavor Name: Chocolate Milkshake,the United States,2016-01-22

I used to be an athlete in college, and I know how gross some protein shakes can be; many are just downright unpalatable.  I did some research about protein powders with a decent amount of protein that both mix well and taste great, and I ordered Syntha-6 Chocolate Milkshake.  For nearly a month, I consumed this flavor 1-3 days depending on my nutritional needs, workouts, etc.  In order to attain some variety, I also ordered Orange Smoothie, Mochaccino, and Chocolate Mint.  I also have subscribed to the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor, but it has yet to come.  I mix all flavors with water and ice.Chocolate Milkshake: Taste - 8/10.  Very creamy, tastes a lot like a variation of chocolate milk just with water.  This flavor is also excellent blended with a teaspoon of peanut butter or 2/3 cup of frozen strawberries.Orange Smoothie : Taste - 5/10.  It's ok.  It's going to be my bottom-of-the-barrell, use-it-only-when-it's-my-only-option flavor.  It tastes too off, almost like orange fluoride from the dentist.  Still very creamy.  I blended it with ice and blue berries and it was WAY better-tasting than just with the powder alone.Mochaccino: Taste- 7/10.  It's good and gets me through coffee cravings.  Sometimes I'll just say ""screw it"" and make a blended drink much like large coffee chains do, but I'll use the power, ice, and and a to-go packet of instant coffee in the blender.  It does kind of have a funky aftertaste.Chocolate Mint: Taste - 10/10.  My favorite flavor so far by a long shot.  Since I don't eat sweets, the Chocolate Mint flavor satisfies my cravings for Girl Scout Thin Mints, Andes Mints, and mint chocolate chip ice cream all in one.  I cannot emphasize how great it tastes.  The minty flavor stays with me like mint normally does, like fresh feeling in the mouth and back of throat.",Flavor Name: Vanilla Ice Cream,the United States,2014-03-22

The taste is better than any other brand I've sampled, with the exception of maybe Muscle MIlk - but this product is whey, and it's more useful for post-workout nutrition than the casein in Muscle Milk. I digress; the taste is awesome, the consistency is not very thick when mixed with water or even milk (so while it's not like a milkshake, it has a pleasant consistency that does the job).PRICE: 7/10Whey is always expensive - especially flavored whey. But Syntha-6 is competitively priced at ~$50/5lb supply, and it certainly beats GNC's outrageous pricing.SHIPPING: 10/10Always 2 days with Prime.CONSISTENCY OF SERVICE/QUALITY: 9/10Product always arrives with the accurate amount, flavor, and is always fresh. This whey protein is not whey isolate (isolate has a higher absorption rate and is thus more effective), but consumers buying this product know that and the price for whey concentrate here is more than fair. I don't think shelling out 1.5x more cash to benefit from 20-30% higher absorption rates is worth the money. This product is thus ideal for serious athletes on a budget.PACKAGING: 10/10Arrives in a box; the jug of powder has a seal that is easily removd. Unlike a lot of protein brands, locating the little scoop is relatively easy to do with this product. Jug is durable.OVERALL: 8.5/10Perfect source of whey protein at a competitive price. Taste is great - in fact, I primarily use water and mix 1-2 scoops with creatine and D-ribose, and the taste is still delicious for protein. With milk it tastes virtually like chocolate milk should, but is slightly thicker in consisteny. Never had an issue to contact the vendor over, but delivery is reliable at ~2 days via Prime over the past 12+ months. Overall, this is a tremendous buy that you should jump on once you're in need of more whey to fuel your gains!",Flavor Name: Chocolate Milkshake,the United States,2015-09-13

The Beverly International UMP Protein Powder in Chocolate is one that has consistently stood out for its quality, taste, and overall effectiveness.The first thing you'll notice about this product is the flavor. The chocolate is rich and satisfying, without being overly sweet or artificial tasting. It's a pleasure to drink, which is not something I can say about all protein powders.The texture is also top-tier. It mixes smoothly and easily, resulting in a shake that's creamy and enjoyable to drink. There's no gritty residue or chalky aftertaste, which is a common complaint with many other protein powders on the market.In terms of nutritional value, this protein powder packs a punch. Each serving provides 20g of protein, which is ideal for supporting lean muscle growth and recovery. With only 4g of carbs and 1g of sugar per serving, it's a great choice for those looking to maintain a low carb or sugar diet.From personal experience, I've found that this protein powder aids in building lean muscle effectively. After incorporating it into my post-workout routine, I noticed visible improvements in muscle definition and strength. Unlike some other protein powders, it didn't cause any bloating or discomfort, which is a significant plus.As for usage, I recommend taking this protein powder post-workout to aid in muscle recovery. However, it can also be used as a meal replacement or snack to support your overall protein intake throughout the day.When it comes to ingredient quality, Beverly International doesn't cut corners. They use high-quality sources of protein, including milk protein isolate and whey protein concentrate. This blend ensures a steady supply of essential amino acids to your muscles, promoting optimal growth and recovery.Compared to other protein powders on the market, Beverly International UMP Protein stands out.

I look for 4 things when picking out ...,"I've been taking some form of protein powder for over a 20 year period.  Recently, I've looked for an all in one powder that I can readily make and shake after workouts as well as before bed or during the day if I need a quick meal replacement. This would replace whey after a workout, and casein before bed I am just tired of buying multiple bottles of protein powder. I also just started using a new pre workout instead of C4

    .  I found it cheap and works well. This stuff with protein on an otherwise empty stomach in the AM before cardio is really shredding the fat away and gives me great energy throughout the day!Anyway this protein product fit the bill nicely. I look for 4 things when picking out a protein powder (not in any particular order) :1) Nutrient profile: This has 22 grams of protein, and includes a mix of whey and casein, which is what I was taking before in two separate products. It also has 15 grams of carbs, which is pretty low (I'll buy anything below 20g of carbs, but the lower the better).2) Flavor: Taste is pretty good. I usually get protein in either chocolate or vanilla, and I got the Vanilla Syntha-6. It doesn't have any sweetener aftertaste or gritty flavor, which is a problem. I usually mix it with water, it tastes as good in water as it can taste. I'll occasionally mix it with milk, which makes it almost creamy tasting but beware Dairy can make you hold water so I only do that when I am bulking or not worried about overall calorie intake.3) Mixability: Syntha-6 mixes extremely well in water or milk in my shaker bottle, with no clumps. A little bit sticks to the side, which I will chalk up to normal it’s sort of unavoidable.4) Price: Price was descent and better than I can find in a GNC or similar store.  Under $25 for over 28 servings of quality protein is a good deal. It's not the cheapest protein powder, but you get what you pay for.IDK everyone has their own favorite protein but this one seems to cover a lot of bases especially if your not prepping for a show.

I wish it had lower levels of cholesterol (they’re not very high but still would want it to be a little lower), but I also know that some cholesterol is actually necessary for your body, as all of the membranes of the cells have cholesterol in them. The protein itself seems to be from very high quality amino-acids, which are very important for real muscle growth.It’s very good because it also makes decrease my food craving and my appetite (which may be because of the high protein levels itself). And it does not give me any side or negative effects.The product content is quite good, and it will last very long, so for the price I think it’s very good.So far, so good, it really has helped me to gain some muscle at the gym, without gaining fat related weight, it has done it’s job, I love it.

I work at a youth camp doing lifeguarding during the summer and various physically strenuous maintenance tasks during the winter.  I'm not sure how this would work for someone trying to pack on serious muscle for various competitions, but for me this works great.  I use it for two things, to add extra protein to my diet and to add usable calories (as opposed to candy bars and snacks).When not doing the hard labor, I mix one shake serving with two cups of chocolate or strawberry milk (depending on the flavor of the shake and drink it in place of a meal when I don't feel like eating and it gives me enough calories and nutrition to keep my body going.When I am doing hard labor (tree cutting, wood splitting, etc) I use these to supplement my protein intake and add more calories.  During times of heavy labor, I'll need around 5,000 to 6,000 calories a day, but I don't usually have the time to stop and have a fourth and fifth meal and these fit the bill perfectly.  I do the straight shakes to help me cram more calories into my body and to help me recover with extra protein.The taste is also great; I have both the strawberry shake and the chocolate shake and while you can still tell they are protein shakes, you don't have to force them down like other shakes.  I would not choose these over a real milkshake (like some reviewers imply) but they are still really good and satisfy your sweet tooth quite nicely.If you want pure protein, these are probably not the greatest since it has a good dose of carbs and fats, but if you just need more protein in your diet and a few extra calories, you can't go wrong with these.*note- do not drink these before a meal if you have to make sure to get calories from the meal.

My favorite for a long time was the GNC chocolate whey protein. Folks, everything else is pure gruel compared to Syntha-6.I purchased a 2.91 pound jug of ""Chocolate Milkshake."" I tried it with milk and it was good but really creamy. With trepidation, I tried it with nothing but water... and found that it was DELICIOUS, especially if you add a few ice cubes. Not only is it delicious, it also keeps me full for hours! This stuff is so good, it's the first jug of protein powder I've ever actually FINISHED!I just ordered two more jugs: chocolate, and ""Vanilla Ice Cream."" A few minutes ago I took a scoop of the vanilla in 5 ounces of water... and it tastes exactly like melty vanilla ice cream. It is sooo delicious, perhaps even moreso than the chocolate! It definitely has a sweeter taste -- it was so sweet that I had to check the label to confirm that, yep, it still has only 2 grams of sugar. SO good.I drink this stuff every day. I usually shake up a couple scoops with 10 ounces of water before I leave the house (note: a good shaker bottle is a necessity), and have it along with a piece of fruit for carbs. It keeps me full to the point that I have to remind myself when it's time for lunch! I generally drink more on weight-lifting days, and if it's near bedtime and I realize my protein intake was low for the day, I'll make a quick shake with one scoop.My muscles have definitely felt fuller since I've started drinking this regularly, and my strength has gone up, and my body weight has gone down.100% RECOMMENDED!--Update, September 2012: I continue to adore this protein powder. My current method of making the drink is mixing two rounded scoops with 10 ounces of unsweetened vanilla almond milk, adding a few drops of peppermint extract, a few ice cubes, and shaking it all up in my Blender Bottle (the one with the metal ball that eliminates clumps). It tastes DIVINE, it and at 450 calories it fills me up for hours. At night I'll drink it alone for some protein before I go to bed, and in the morning I'll have it with a piece of fruit. So tasty!

I bought this powder because it's 100% whey, banned-substance tested, and it has a good rep. Here's why it gets all 5 stars-Taste: it's great. The vanilla ice cream mixed with just milk REALLY taste like a milkshake. It's amazing without all the extra added sugars. Keep in mind though I recommend mixing this in with a fruit smoothie, for the carb replishment and also some extra nutrients. If for some reason you're picky and you don't like the taste of fruit, this flavor is actually so good that it makes it taste like a strawberry milkshake (if you use some strawberries).Recovery: before this powder I occasionally took muscle milk. I thought it was normal to just be sore and tight for hours or even days after a tough long workout. But after taking this stuff, I don't feel that extreme soreness or tightness anymore. Don't get me wrong, you WILL still feel sore, but it definitely lowers the intensity. I feel stronger than my soreness in a way, whereas before my muscles would slow me down.Overall this powder is very versatile and simple and should be in everybody's supplement box.

I have more energy and I don't get as hungry before dinner on days I drink the shake compared to eating my normal light lunch of a sandwich and a few chips or fruit.I previously was using Spiri-tein whey protein powder (meal) and thought I'd give this a try.  Gold Standard is is better in some ways, but not as good in others.Taste - (I mix it with Blue Diamond Reduced Sugar Almond milk) The Gold Standard tastes much better.  With Spiri-tein, I needed to add cocoa to the vanilla flavored drink to make it easier to drink. It still had an odd after taste that was almost like an artificial sweetener wang, but it doesn't have artificial sweetener in it.  I love the taste of Gold Standard Vanilla just as it is.  It really tastes like a vanilla shake. I can add cocoa if I want, but it's not necessary.Blending - Spiri-tein tops Gold Standard in blending.  It takes a little longer to initially blend, but it stays blended, whereas Gold Standard will separate if left standing very long.  (Blue Diamond Almond milk used)Economy - A serving size of Gold Standard is larger than a serving of Spiri-tein.  The Gold Standard powder is fluffier so that may explain it.Filling - Spiri-tein is more filling and keeps me from getting hungry longer than the same size shake made with Gold Standard. Spiri-tein tended to cause more intestinal gas.  Spiri-tein is actually called a ""meal"" rather than just a supplement.  It has more added vitamins and ingredients, so it makes sense that it would fill me up more and last longer.Not sure which one really comes out on top.  I like both for different reasons.  Gold Standard comes in a BIG plastic jar with a screw on lid.  Some settling evidently occurs because it looks only 2/3 full when opened.  Spiri-tein comes in a more compact cardboard canister with plastic snap on lid and is also available in individual packets that are good for travel.

I totally love this stuff.I bought this product after having a conversation with my pet grizzly bear.One lazy afternoon, we were chilling on the couch and I asked Mr. Grizzles how he got so buff. He then told me his life story. God, it was so boring. He went through all this crap about his troubled upbringing and how hard it was living in the forest. I mean, from his story you would think he was the only person that ever had to take dumps outside. I live in a suburban neighborhood and I still take dumps outside just for fun sometimes. I think he is just spoiled these days.Anyways, one day Mr. Grizzles stumbled upon a deserted campsite and discovered that the campers had accidentally left behind a carton of this brotein powder. He started taking it with every meal, and immediately noticed results. At first he just started bulking up. And then he started gelling his hair, wearing necklaces, and wearing untucked fitted collared shirts. Finally, he joined a fraternity. In just a matter of weeks, he was a full bro.Impressed by his story, I bought a carton of it. I have to say that it didn't seem to have the same results for me. But, in terms of pure brotein, it gets the job done.Brotip: Mix a scoop of this into one serving of greek yogurt, and then add some chopped almonds and raspberries to it.

Flynn,4.0,"Meets the need, but taste and smell need improvement","I started using this after learning my breakfast and lunch don't supply a lot of protein.  Since I am trying to lose weight, I was stalling due to too little calories and my body was hoarding fat. I needed something to add a few additional calories and protein, and whey protein was recommended. Finding a whey protein without artificial sugars is very difficult, so I was happy to give this product a try. In addition to detesting the taste of artificial sugars, along with the negative things I have read about the use of them, I was determined to find a product that didn't use them.I just mix it with water.  It blends fine using a free water container I received at a health fair - nothing fancy, just a plastic bottle with a screw cap.  I'm trying to keep calories and sugars down, so I chose this flavor.  I found that adding a dash of vanilla extract improves the flavor, but it still has a musty smell.  Since I only take it once a day, I figure I can live with both the taste and the flavor.  My husband has started to use it in a banana smoothy on those days he doesn't eat well and he doesn't even notice it is in there, so the taste and smell can obviously be hidden if you add something that actually has a flavor.The good news is that after I started to use it, my weight loss began again.  I'm not going for a fast loss rate, just acquiring better eating and exercise habits and reaping the benefits of both.Since it is only the flavor and smell I find a problem with, I am giving this 4 stars.  If I were rating it on effectiveness only, it would be a 5 star product.11/3/12 Update:I reordered this product and it tasted markedly different - no mustiness.  Since I had never tried it prior to the order in the above review, I didn't know what it was SUPPOSED to taste like.  When I was ready for my 3rd order, Amazon had a notice about there being a problem with the product at that time and they were not selling it until the issue was resolved.  That makes me think my 1st order contained 2 jars that probably shouldn't have been sold.  I had no ill effects from them, just didn't care for smell nor taste.As for the weight loss, I did lose an additional 7 lb over 2 months, but seem to be stalling again.  I only wish to lose 7 more pounds, so may add an additional serving of this to rev up my metabolism and give my body something to work with in the afternoon.",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2012-09-01

I had read reviews of the various flavors of ON protein powders and this flavor was generally highly rated.  I liked that with vanilla, I could blend in cocoa powder or various extracts to shift the flavor to something a bit different.  So far, it has worked well on its own, as a primary ingredient in keto ""protein pancakes"", and in cold and warm ""lattes"" (as with any protein powder, you have to be careful not to overheat the mixture or the proteins will coagulate and have a curdled appearance).  My digestive system can be finicky, but I haven't had any problems digesting this protein.  So far, it has been a great quality protein at a great price.  I will not be re-purchase at the current price of $164.99.

For me personally, the taste is better than any vanilla protein drink I've ever had. It's sweetened with evaporated cane juice so there aren't any artificial sweeteners and it's also void of artificial colors. If you're picky about certain ingredients, this does contain ""xanthan gum,"" which is typically added as a thickening agent.Nutritionally, xanthan gum is a carbohydrate with 7 grams of fiber per tablespoon. This may cause bloating in some people. Xanthan gum may be derived from a variety of sources such as corn, wheat, or soy.  People with an allergy to one of the above need to avoid this or do more research to ascertain the source.The 2lb container is 909 grams and provides 28 rounded scoops. Each scoop contains 130 calories, 1 gr of fat, 0.5 sat fat, 0 trans fat, 30mg of cholesterol, 60 mg sodium, 5g carbs, 3g sugar, and 24g of protein.If you're concerned with additional ingredients that have weird scientific names, another low on the list is rebaudioside A. I was curios as to what that was and found out it's another name for Stevia. (another natural sweetener.)What I'm not sure about is if this product contains some of the harmful metals that are abundant in many of the popular protein powders out there. I don't see any in the ingredient list but I'm not sure if they're hidden somewhere? If anyone knows I'd love to find out!All in all, this is a great tasting product with a lot of protein, low (natural) sugar and a great taste. I don't like to clean so I usually steer clear of the blender - but this mixes up great with a glass of milk and a fork!Look forward to trying the chocolate flavor next.....hope you enjoy!",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2014-05-10

I was completely expecting a bland and generally lousy tasting protein.  In fact, I tend to avoid anything ON-Brand that even hints of vanilla flavor.  I think that 
  
Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Vanilla Ice Cream







  
  
     is absolutely terrible and my experience with ON's other all-natural product 
  
Oats & Whey Vanilla Bean







  
  
     was miserable.  Despite this, the price was attractive enough to convince me and I gave it a whirl....Shockingly, this protein is NOT terrible! It doesn't have a strong vanilla flavor, but it does have a light, tasty and authentic flavor.  Although I mixed 1 scoop with about 6-7oz of cold bottled water, I think it would be vastly better mixed with skim milk, almond milk or coconut milk.  It would also work VERY nicely in a banana puree or smoothie drink since it will thicken the drink without spoiling the natural flavor of the fruits.My only criticism would be the fairly high carb and fat content (5g and 1.5g respectively) which can really add up depending on how many scoops a day you are supplementing with.  I would always rather get my carbs from real food instead of my protein supplement.Though there's no artificial sweetener added, it does have ""Fructose"" in it (which sounds suspiciously like high-fructose corn syrup to me.... which technically speaking is ""natural"") So, I'm not completely convinced that I'm much better off with this product compared to their ""regular"" protein.Overall, it's not a bad whey matrix, especially if you find it on sale.

I was looking for a protein powder for the sole purpose of helping my muscles recover faster so I'm not sore for days after a hard lift, essentially so that I can hit it again quicker.  With that goal in mind, this powder seems to have helped.  I'd say my post-workout soreness is less than half of what it is without taking this after lifting.  I realize that as I get in better shape the soreness will decrease, as I have lifted on and off for several years, so I know the game to some degree.  I'm looking at it from the point of view of workouts that would normally leave me sore.On to the taste and mix-ability.  The taste isn't really that great, but it's not bad if you mix it with a good 16oz of water.  It doesn't mix all that well with just a spoon in a pint glass, but it mixes well enough to get the job done.  You get some clumps, but it's not bad.  I don't mess around with a blender or anything for this; I just dump a scoop-full in a tall glass of water and drink it.  It does leave me feeling very full when I'm done, for better or worse.The other thing I like about this is the relatively low calorie count.  One of the main reasons I'm working out is to lose weight, so I'm not interested in taking on any more calories than need be.Based on all these things, I'd buy it again.

I'm not trying to look like The Rock (at least not yet).Again, A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. product & flavor.

The flavor of the vanilla is good but a tad strong. I'm mixing it with straight milk and it ends up tasting like a vanilla soymilk (I haven't had regular vanilla milk). The problem is the aftertaste... it's not bad, it just sticks with you for a looooooong time unless you rinse your mouth or eat/drink something else. If you don't you may get sick of the flavor and not want to try it again for a while. So make sure to distract your tastebuds with something else after a drink of this.2.

The consistency too is fantastic, easily soluble in water and even in milk, which is normally too viscous and non-polar to make a usable protein shake.The actual formula is very impressive as well. Besides the titular whey protein, it has the added benefit of including 5.5 g of branched chain amino acids (BCAA's), critical for protein synthesis, as well as 4 g of glutamine, whose benefits are less clear than the previous ingredients, but still offers a marginal boost to standard formulas.The value is great here, literally should be a staple in everyone's pantry.

I usually purchase one of ON's chocolate varieties, but I had been wanting to try something new. Since they don't carry the 1 lb. size at my local GNC, Amazon to the rescue! To me, the Vanilla Ice Cream has a very strong artificially sweet taste, probably due to the sucralose. Double Rich Chocolate, one of my favs, does not contain sucralose. Well, my last 5 lb. tub didn't; maybe that's changed! Double Rich Choc Ingredients:  Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolates, Whey Protein Concentrate, Whey Peptides), Cocoa (Processed with Alkali), Lecithin, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Acesulfame Potassium, Aminogen®, Lactase. In any case, I add my protein powder to a shake with spinach and kale, so the taste is quite muted. Used in this manner, the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor was fine; greens cut the sweetness perfectly! However, when I mixed it into plain Greek yogurt, all I could taste was an overwhelming dose of artificial sweetener! That said, I won't repurchase this flavor. Even though I liked it in the green shake, which is how I typically consume protein powder, I'm not thrilled about the addition of sucralose. Can't imagine how sickeningly sweet this would taste for those who mix with just water, almond milk, etc. Yikes!

Ever try making aspirin taste good? If they came out with dirt water that had 75 grams of protein per serving, I'd drink it! It's just fuel to me.With that said, this protein tastes fine! I like it!It has a light vanilla taste, mild... less sweet tasting (was going to get vanilla ice cream)smell is typical protein drink-ish, little weirdmixes well (in water and in my oatmeal) so probably in anythingdoes it job, rebuilds muscle!no gas like some othersI am sure there are other more efficient protein drinks out there that absorb awesome but they probably cost upwards $70. ON is a great bang for the buck!If you are newer to health and have a real concerned about being able to tolerate protein drink flavors, ask for a sample from the company or from your local heath food store instead of guessing. It will save you from wasting your money especially if you are on a tight budget.",Flavor Name: Vanilla,the United States,2012-11-30

The bottle says you can use your favorite beverage to mix with, but I just use water to avoid any extra calories.  I usually have this shake in the morning after I work out and it will keep me full for several hours.  I'm a lager guy 6'1 277 lbs so I have a very big appetite.  After drinking this shake I sometimes feel like I could still eat something, but I just let time pass and eventually the hunger will go away.  Within the first 3 days of using this product I lost about 4 pounds.  I was around 283 lbs when I starting drinking this stuff for breakfast and dinner and before I knew it I was below 280.  Making up this shake is really easy to do and only takes about 5 minutes.  If you are significantly less weight than me, you will probably be full immediately after drinking this.  Since I'm a big guy I think I have a much bigger appetite.  I just bought another bottle yesterday as a back up because I know I'll be drinking all of this stuff up.In all honestly, it can be a little expensive but if you want a shake that can replace ONE daily meal, I would absolutely buy this stuff.  I love having this on hand because if I am not in the mood to cook, or I'm tempted to eat unhealthy for dinner or lunch, I know I can come back to this product and take care of my hunger.  Some of the reviews on here say that people are using it multiple times a day for each meal, however I wouldn't recommend it.  I think it would be better at a maximum of 2 meals per day.",Flavor Name: Strawberry,the United States,2017-03-28

I am purchasing this shake in the hope to control my appetite and cravings, to lose some weight with portion control and some exercise.  I will be using this shake as a lunch replacement once a day.My first impression after receiving my strawberry shake mix-I didnt receive a scoop in the powder, and I dug pretty far to the bottom? So I took the scoop out of a different protein powder I had. My scoop is 35 grams and I mixed ONE scoop to 10 oz water. Today I had this shake for supper at 4pm. And it was actually VERY good compared to all other shakes I have had in the past. I drank it in a few minutes, It was smooth and tasted similar to strawberry nesquick milk...Update(3/22/17): It is 8:30 pm and I have NO appetie. No cravings and feel full.Update (3/24/17): I have been consuming the this drink the last few days at the same ratio 10 oz to ONE scoop powder. I have been having it as my lunch and I am usually full till ATLEAST 5pm and do not eat much for supper and wake up not very hungry (THAT IS CRAZY FOR ME).  My diet has been eggs and toast in the morning, snack around 10 am usually peanuts, shake for lunch, some kind of lean protein for supper and veggies... I eat and I am really not that hungry...it is AMAZING!The last few days have made me realize how much bad stuff I have been eating?! I have tried SO many diet shakes, and once they leave the body, you typically feel starved and eat worse, but this shake must be magic (haha!).I  can't believe how much my appetite has been controlled  CONTINOUSLY!!I will post updates as I go on with this Meal replacement! We will see if the ""full"" effect lasts, and if i have any weightloss results!",Flavor Name: Strawberry,the United States,2017-03-23

I always mix it with different fruits in a blender, I even add supplements and vitamins in it and no bad reactions.***To reduce belly fat I'd add green tea extract in the smoothie (**green tea extract dont make you feel jittery the way green tea does**) and it worked like a charm.

I was disappointed in the chocolate flavor as I found it terribly sweet and artificial tasting. From other reviews, I expected it to taste like an actual milkshake not a shake made by Dow Chemical. To make it more bearable I tried using a smaller amount and also tried mixing with milk and coffee, which tasted worse. Then I threw some into a blender with a cup of raspberries which was delicious and filling. To tolerate it at lunch time, I add some PB2 powdered peanut butter and that cuts the artificial sweetness. I haven't used it consistently, so I haven't lost weight but I haven't gained any more weight either, and I've noticed that when I use it I overeat less at night (I think because I'm getting a lot of protein during the day). I also haven't been exercising due to illness and frigid outdoor temps, so I expect my weight will start to drop when I can resume working out.  I was disappointed to have to take the extra step of using a blender to add berries and make it palatable (which is really inconvenient in the morning), but I started blending berries and water ahead of time and later combining this with the powder in a blender bottle--it mixes REALLY easily and smoothly even into this gloppy fruit puree.

When she came out with her WelleCo line of nutritional supplements, I was eager to try the Super Elixir until I found out the price.  While this isn't powdered greens, I still jumped at the opportunity to sample the brand's protein powder.  I got the vanilla flavor and have been enjoying it well enough.  Considering the price, I can't say the flavor is all that much superior to other plant-based protein powders I've tried.  It still has the chalky aftertaste, although it isn't as sickeningly sweet as most.  I love the fact that it's very low in fat (1.3g) and calories (123) while still delivering nearly 20g of protein per serving.  I often add frozen berries or bananas to give it a flavor boost and make it a more filling and complete breakfast.  While this is a good vegan protein powder, the price prevents me from recommending it over other ones on the market.  Personally, when you buy WelleCo, part of what you're paying for is the glamour and prestige attached to MacPherson's famous name (and physique).",VINE VOICE,the United States,2020-11-02

My view is that their Myoplex line of meal replacements is the best that I've tried.  These products offer a good ratio of protein and complex carbs to cholesterol and fat.  I use them at home and on the road.  At home I often blend them with other ingredients to add some flavor and calories.  On the road I'll have them in a shaker first thing in the morning in my hotel room.  Our bodies are nutrient starved in the morning and often times a ""healthy"" breakfast will not provide enough protein so that's why I personally choose to have it in the morning.  Othertimes of day, if I feel the need to add protein I usually go for the simple (and cheaper) Whey protein as part of a shake.The taste, even just with cold water, is quite good and the texture is creamy.  The only reason Myoplex isn't getting 5 stars is that the price seems to be inching ever higher.

The vanilla is extremely difficult to mix up. It remains clumpy and grainy no matter what media I add or temp I mix at. It has an overpowering vanilla flavor and horrendous chemically aftertaste. I looked up MANY protein shake recipes searching for a way to blend this into edibility. It's just not possible. The vanilla is irredeemably disgusting.Another issue is that the packets are gigantic. I was unable to mix up a whole one with water, milk or anything else  (I even tried coffee). You would need a huge volume of liquid to blend it into a palatable texture (something thinner than pudding), and then you would have a 24-32oz disgusting shake to choke down... um, no thank you. The obvious solution to this is to use less powder, but at that point, you're no longer getting 42g of protein... more like 20 something if you can only fit half of it in 17oz of water. Might as well buy an Ensure instead.The chocolate is tolerable. It's not *good*, but it's not nauseating either. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, so I expect normal people will find this one to be adequate. I mixed it with water and some peanut butter powder. It was still grainy, but adequate. Reminds me of cool, watered down hot chocolate.  It might be good if prepared warm with skim milk and a dash of cayenne pepper  (like Mexican hot cocoa).I did not try the strawberry. Nor do I plan to.If you feel you must try one of these, get the chocolate. The vanilla's aftertaste is long lasting and repulsive.Better yet, try the Ready-to-drink version. They get much better reviews.These are NOT convenient and do NOT taste good. But they are affordable and full of protein and vitamins. If you need a meal replacement option on a budget, and can choke down anything, then these are ideal.",Verified Purchase,the United States,2017-05-16

This year has had its challenges, and could have been a glitch in inventory.I had already begun drinking a few servings before taking note of this. I'll finish it off since it only has 9 servings anyway.  I can say it was extremely well packaged- no air could get in, and it smells fresh and tastes fine. I have used protein powders well past their best by date without issue. I expect the same here, but.. clearly I hope no one ends up buying/receiving a 6 months past Best By date (and it had been manufactured 2.5 years AGO). Hence why I am pointing it out and not overlooking it completely.So outside of that.. the taste is (still) pleasant- has a light vanilla flavor that is easy to drink. Is gentle on stomach. This is pea and brown rice proteins, which I find tend to be more gentle than whey or soy. I am usually good with any plant based (except soy) protein. This one is good. Not stand out spectacular, but it is good enough. No weird after taste. I can mix it plain with water or a non dairy milk, and it tastes fine. I just shake it and drink it.This is a considered a ""refill"". So it is a packet of powder with zip closure.

I use protein powder as a meal replacement in a smoothie.  My last protein powder that I liked was loaded with carbs so because I would like to lose some weight in the process that was probably not going to do it, but keep me satiated all day.  I have a job where I  basically work all day without a lunch break so I need a protein/meal replacement drink that I can sip on throughout the day and will basically satiate me for the better part of the day that I can carry in an insulated lunch lunch  bag on ice.  I am not working today so I will have to see if this works with this protein powder and come back with another review.

I am also a doctor and tend to run quite skeptical on the nutraceutical products and their claims, so I spend a fair bit of time actually evaluating the research to have some idea of what is actually evidence based or not.  Ultimate Nutrition's product serves up 25g of protein per serving which is respectable.  It accomplishes that with whey concentrate, isolate and hydrolysate.  Is there some advantage to the more processed forms?  Probably not, but they wont hurt you either, just add cost.  So far standard stuff.  Then we get into the ""Fat Burning"" part of the ticket.  Synephrine, green coffee bean extract, choline.  Of all the dietary ""fat burner"" chemicals, to my knowledge caffeine is the only one with a true proven effect.  Presumably there is some in here related to the green coffee bean, but they do not specify the amount of caffeine per se.  Other items, such as the synephrine (which is related to the catecholamine norepinephrine) are added to give you the physical side effects which make you think you are burning fat, but do not actually burn fat (best available evidence).  They make you feel warm and jittery, which feeds the placebo effect and makes you think the product is burning fat.  This is an old trick that many fat burners use - especially when they add Niacin which makes you feel flushed but does nothing for weight loss.  Anyway, it has caffeine in it, so that may help with weight loss, the rest is junk science.  The probiotics also just add cost, but not true scientific evidence that they help with anything unless you are also taking an antibiotic, then maybe.  The flavor is reasonable and it is sweetened with Stevia, which is a plus in my book.Some things I really want to know about a whey product is not addressed anywhere on the package.  How is the whey sourced?  Was it tested for heavy metal contamination (common among more cheaply sourced whey)?Conclusion:  This is a decent-tasting whey protein supplement which gives you a decent dose of protein along with some caffeine.  I will definitely be taking it without much reservation.  The rest is marketing and play off of the junk science nutraceutical industry which would have you believe that their supplement evidence is far more robust than it really is.  The bitter orange, ECGC, probiotics, etc, if they are really in there, only serve to drive up cost, but have no proven benefit outside of Men's/Women's Health and Muscle mags industry-funded, pseudo-science articles.  Caffeine does seem to work, though.  FYI.",VINE VOICE,the United States,2019-06-26

Nice light vanilla wafer taste,"The short of it: This is actually really really good. It has a vanilla flavor that isn't too artificial tasting. Reminds me of a vanilla wafer. I drink all sorts of protein powder mixes, nutritional shakes, etc, and have learned to expect and tolerate some weird flavors, but this is nice. It doesn't need anything to mask the flavor.Still though, I like adding a few goodies to it- to switch things up- like frozen strawberries or blueberries, sometimes add some pumpkin or Greek yogurt, and so on. The usual smoothie fodder. It all pairs well with this product. It is also very good with just some ice and ""milk"" of choice. Keep in mind to follow directions and limit your intake of this product to just one serving per day. And not to take if under 18, or are nursing or pregnant.I love that it is low sodium (50 mg)I want to say that my typical eating routine is to pretty much not eat until about 1-2pm. In the morning I will have a cup of coffee, some water, and that's it. I don't do it for any reason beyond that it works for my lifestyle. If I'm hungry, then I eat or drink a smoothie.  I prefer an early dinner, so usually a couple hours before dinner as I feel my hunger kicking in, I may nibble or just make some sort of smoothie.So when I got this product, I figured I would make my first several servings just with unsweetened almond milk, a scoop of this powder, a handful of ice then blended it together. No added bulk from other goodies. Just powder and milk! Each time I had it I started off HUNGRY. Then, I would drink a portion of it and still feel hungry, but less so. After I finished it, I would still be a little hungry. Not wanting to eat anything, I just carried on. It would be within a half hour though that I would realize that I was no longer hungry. I just felt fine. Like, sure I could probably eat, but I was no longer HANGRY. Ya know? When dinner finally came around I wasn't totally famished. Great!I did not weigh or measure myself. I should do that. But what I can tell you in terms of how I feel.. is that with nothing else having been changed, I feel more..energized. Not hyped up, but more like that feeling of when the sun comes out after a cloudy day. I am just getting up earlier and starting my day with some ambition. I have no idea if the product has anything to do with it, but I'm getting stuff done. I just am feeling good these past several days, and it is so uplifting and satisfying to just feel better.

If you are looking for a boost in the quest to lose some weight, then this is it!","GET IT / DON’T GET IT? This Fat Burner Protein powder gets a 100% GET IT from me.I have been on a health journey for the last year. I quit drinking and decided to tackle my weight by developing healthy habits of working out for 30 -60 minutes a day and cycling at the weekends. I wanted to do this instead of using specific diets to lose the weight.When I started I was 189 lbs at 5’7”, and it all started when I went to the store to buy new pants for a new job and the 36 would no longer fit and I would have to get 38. I put the size 36 back on the rack, and walked out. I decided on the spot that I was not going to keep spending money to accommodate my unhealthy lifestyle as my size kept increasing.Fast forward to a year later and I am at 153.4 lbs with a 30” waist and I seem to have hit a plateau which I cannot pass. The original goal was to get to 145 by the anniversary of the day I quit drinking, and here I was a few weeks out from that stuck date in the early 150’s when I saw this product.I track absolutely everything in my fitness activities, and was excited to see how this performed.Day 1 - 153.4 lbsDay 2 - 152.2 lbsDay 3 - 150.6 lbs…So at this point I was thinking I could stop about half way through the container, but then it went back up a little, which I can only assume is my body deciding how it would handle whatever it was being fed.The following few weeks saw a dip in the progress as it hovered around the 150 - 151 lbs zone, with a departure or two back towards 153.Then, coming up to the day of my anniversary, it started to decline, and after a total of 4 weeks, on the actual day itself it finally got to 146.8 lbs. That was close enough to 145 lbs for me to declare victory...So, over the course of a few weeks I went from 153.4 to 146.8 lbs which was even more impressive because I was at a stubborn stage where I had been unable to get below 153 for about a month. The results are awesome, although I no longer look good in anything sized a medium and I have to buy small clothes (which I am perfectly fine with:)PROSIt really works in boosting your metabolism, and the results are fantastic26 grams of protein per servingBecause it is also a protein power, you are gaining muscle as you lose weight.CONSNot really a con - but I didn’t love the flavor when mixed with water. Maybe only mixing it with water gets you the best results, but I would prefer to see other options listed with a % performance from each option. Having said that, with these results, it doesn't really matter about the taste :)Not really a con either - but I didn’t notice any curbing of my appetite - not an issue because I’m never super hungry.SUMMARYMad love for this product. It got me within 1.8 lbs of my target weight for which I am super grateful. Will definitely get more if I need to. I fully recommend this product.",( ,the United States,2019-07-01

I have tried many different brands over the last couple years since I started doing this, and the Ultimate Nutrition brand is...well, okay.The flavor isn't anything to brag about. I have found that it tastes better mixed with a chocolate peanut butter protein powder (that actually tastes great all alone), but by itself wasn't disgusting, but nothing I genuinely looked forward to drinking if I'm being honest.I have a personal blender which helps with the blending instead of using a blender bottle, which can leave a lot of un-dissolved whey in clumps when using blender bottles. I find it just works better this way. This brand is supposed to help burn fat and help with weigh management and reducing hunger due to the protein, which is known to help curb hunger.  I haven't noticed much in the way of fat burning, but protein is pretty good at curbing hunger, and that it seems to do rather well.All in all, it's not the worst Protein Whey drink mix I've tried, but it isn't the best either.",( ,the United States,2019-05-21

Some of these extra ingredients might help with weight loss and appetite control, although I wouldn't expect miracles. For example, it contains synephrine, which is basically a bitter orange extract. The chemical is similar to ephedrine, so it might help with appetite suppression and even fat burning. Just be aware that like ephedrine, some people have experienced similar side effects (like stroke).I like this powder mainly because it is a lower carb formula and contains stevia (I try to avoid the other artificial sweeteners). It also contains protease and lactase, which will help digest the protein and milk sugars contained in the product. It doesn't taste too bad either.Overall this is a decent formula. However, I'm not certain of the safety and effectiveness of synephrine, and after I'm done using this will likely not buy another formula with it.",VINE VOICE,the United States,2019-07-16

The taste seems okay, but I'm usually mixing it in with other things. So I can't really speak too much on just mixing it in with water. But as far as using it for weight loss, I doubt it really works.They offer two explanations as to why this is meant to be ideal for weight loss. One reason is that it's an appetite suppressant, but then that can be said of most protein powder mixes. The other is that it contains thermogenic properties. But it's going to have small amounts of green tea, green coffee bean, etc. So caffeine, and whatever benefits green tea already has.

I'm hoping it's a temporary increase and that the price goes back down somewhat, because it is an excellent protein. It went up nearly doubling in price. I assume that they are likely selling it at close the same margin and that it had to do with the fact their costs went up that much or that they found they were selling it at too small of a margin or at a loss.I've tried lots of protein powders, since I'm 60 and have been taking it since the early 80s. This is a very easy mixing, non clumping, and great tasting product. I don't know about the actual quality with other aspects of this product because I'm not a chemist, but they claim it's very high quality protein  Even the price per protein grams is excellent.  Isolate is not easy to mix normally and usually doesn't have a good taste, so I don't know how they do it?  Definitely a great product.

I bought it because my usual protein was delayed and this was the best value ($10 per lbs) and high quality (over 90%). Having been in the supplement industry for close to 20 years, I am very critical about about what I spend my money on. 75% of the stuff you see advertised is overpriced and under deliveres. Having little familiarity with the brand and no familiarity with the protein, I was very skeptical. But after evaluating all the different reviews, I decided to give it a try and so glad I did. If you have issues with lactose or shop quality over quantity you know that whey isolate is one of the best options when macro numbers matter. This is a high protein, with little to no carbs or fat. It's not overwhelmly sweet and no fake sugar after taste. Mixes well in my shaker cup with a just a few ice cubes with no clumps.

I generally take one serving in the morning with breakfast and one with NOW nutrition's carbo gain after workouts.  I've had the vanilla, fudge, and banana ice cream flavors.  The vanilla and fudge flavors are highly recommended.  The banana is not that bad, I always mix it with water, and with the 8 or so oz. that is recommended to mix with the banana flavor is almost like a banana runt candy with more of a harsh finish on the back of the palate, so I tend to mix it with 12 oz. of water in the morning and with the carbo gain I'll use about 16 oz. of water and it tastes just fine.  All flavors mix very easily.Only products I can compare this with are optimum nutrition gold standard/platinum hydrowhey and muscle pharm combat powder.  This stuff blows the optimum products out of the water in my opinion, especially the hydrowhey which had an incredibly over bearing flavor, and if you do the math the optimum products tend to have a good amount of filler per serving compared to this product.  The combat powder would win in taste but due to the fact I was only seeing result taking three or four servings a day and it had between 27-37% of your daily amount of cholesterol per serving I decided it was best I switched products.  As far as results I've seen, they seem to be more apparent with this product, but I was mainly trying to lose weight while on the previous products I mentioned and have now upped my calorie intake since starting the iso sensation and carbogain regiment, so the results I have seen could potentially be attributed to the increased caloric intake and not just the protein supplement.

The amino acid profile is exceptional, containing massive amounts of BCAAs. While this is an isolate, so there should be few digestive issues (unless you have a milk protein allergy, which is different from lactose intolerance), it's nice that Ultimate Nutrition has included protease and lactase digestive enzymes for good measure. The chocolate fudge flavor tastes great, and while all protein powder tastes best with some kind of milk (cow, soy, almond, etc), Iso Sensation tastes pretty good with water.Two (minor) gripes:-The mixability isn't perfect. Now don't get me wrong, it's very good, at at the very least on par with old stalwarts like ON 100% Whey, but it doesn't necessarily dissolve miraculously. Nutrabio Whey Isolate is the best I've encountered on this front. Again, however, it mixes well, just not the best in its class. If you use a blender it will be a non-issue.-The lid on the container can be a little difficult to get on and off, it secures very tightly.

These are both very pure forms of protein (> 90% pure). The difference between these two proteins is that hydrolyzed protein has smaller protein fragments which are easier to digest than non-hydrolyzed whey protein isolate, but other than that one caveat, they are essentially the same. Other types of whey are not filtered as much (70-80% pure), which means you are getting some of the natural carbs that are found in milk along with the protein. While there is nothing inherently wrong with these extra carbs, most of us don't have any issues getting carbs in our diets, it's the protein we need to focus on.With this in mind I picked the Ultimate Nutrition Iso Sensation.

They perfected the strawberry flavor and easily digested. Strawberry is a flavor that most brands easily mess up. I usually mix mine with powerade that was refrigerated and put one scoop of Isosensation mix/shake it in the powerade bottle and dissolves quickly. I dont need blender or shaker bottle. Convenience is the key. I take it to the gym immediately after mixing it. It does not need time to set or refrigeration. The powder smells wonderful. I use this as a post workout drink and I dont feel bloated and miserable after ingesting it. I am lactose intolerant so my boyfriend got me started with whey isolate since the whey protein makes it really difficult to digest. I believe isosensation although more expensive than most brands out there truly deliver the best quality product. It's microfiltered and the ingredients are superb. You pay for quality. I have tried other brands but I stay loyal with Isosensation. Dont waste your money with cheap brands that have cheap ingredients and poor processing.

Pure Organic Egg White protein...this is the best form of protein...much better than the cheap-quality WHEY protein powders.2.  CLEAN & NO FILLERS:  MRM completely dissolves.  That indicates MRM is providing 'pure' clean protein powder WITHOUT fake fillers.  Almost all other protein powders leave behind residual 'stuff' that doesn't dissolve.  That 'stuff' is the 'filler' used to 'cut' and extend the product (to make it appear like you are getting more powder for your money).3.  DELICIOUS:  Great tasting in either chocolate or vanilla flavors.  Tastes like a real treat...rather than tasting like a medicinal product.4.  HEALTHY:  After taking MRM for a few months, I feel better and more energetic.  I suffered from a poor diet.  MRM was critical to improving my diet.CONS:  Very expensive...but the best-quality products don't come cheap.The VERDICT:  MRM is an essential part of my diet.

It comes in a four-pack and in two colors, Two Black and Two White. Each funnel comes with a decent-quality carabine and key ring loop which is a nice addition. Each funnel holds 6 oz of substance which translates to about two and a half protein powder scoops, and more than enough for my needs and uses as I consider myself to have a decent size stack for pre and post-workout supplements so I was happy to see that I can fit it all in each funnel.Each funnel is made of a nice plastic, and I really enjoy the split color as I use white for pre-workout and black for postworkout. The lids screw on and lock in convincingly as I have never leaked powder and never had an issue opening the lid. I was unsure that spending $20 on four funnels would actually bring that level of value as each one of these funnels is roughly $5, but, I am in love and plan to order more so when I prep my food for the week I can also prep my pre and post powders which were my ultimate goal in getting these which I am happy to be able to attain!This has quickly grown to be one of my favorite things in my gym bag and I think that you will come to the same conclusion as me once you give them a go.

     I just bought this product in hopes of having something compact and portable to take to the gym. It absolutely works! I am always on the go and it is so convenient to have a container that carries my powders. It holds 3 scoops of powder! I love that these containers can be hooked on to my gym bag for a hassle free gym session. I have also, on occasion, used it to carry some hot chocolate mix. The funnel is so practical! I carry a Hydroflask, which has a narrow neck, so the funnel really saves me from making a mess. They are also durable and the price is right!",Verified Purchase,the United States,2022-09-07

And when I would try to keep my daily scooped doses in regular mini containers, they were not smaller than the opening of my bottles and I couldn’t pour successfully into the smaller water bottle openings.

There isn't a whole lot of options for single-serving protein powder dispensers that fit into a normal water bottle.It *only* works decently well with Gold Standard powder (It must be a powder that doesn't clump *at all*.  Think really really dry sand versus just slightly damp sand consistency.  You need the really dry sand consistency).Nothing about this is special.  Their venting technology is just simply unscrewing the cap.  Doing this (see below) for most of the powders actually makes a mess, so I would suggest never opening the top when using.  These are also very hard to hold on to when dumping them into your water bottle if your hands are sweaty or the least bit wet.I tested this against 4 protein powders: Combat, Gold Standard, CytoSport and Orgain Organic.Once you have filled the funnels, you turn them upside down and remove the small cap.  Then put it straight onto an open water bottle.  In theory, you would unscrew the large cap and the powder would slide into the bottle.  This doesn't really work.  If you unscrew the large lid a little bit, you will end up getting powder everywhere because you'll have to tap on the funnel to get all the powder in your water bottle.  The tapping causes powder to escape the top where you loosened it and now you have giant mess.How to actually use:1. Fill the funnel, screw on the large cap.2. Turn over (small cap facing up) and remove the small cap.3. Place the small end in your water bottle4. Keep the large cap screwed tight5. Tap the top 10-20 times to get the protein out of the funnel into your water bottleDo you look odd at the gym doing this?  A bit.Is this the best I could find after hours of searching? Yes.Are they a bit over-priced for being a piece of plastic?  Probably, but there aren't a lot of options either.Edit: After a couple months of using these, I'll say that the convenience out weighs the need to tap the top to have the powder come out.",Color: Silver,the United States,2016-08-18

It was a mess! I also tried that huge water bottle shaker container with the metal ball in it, but it was such a pain carrying it in my bag afterwards. I prefer packing the Powder Jet with protein/flax powder/chlorella/spirulina at home, which is a very convenient and small size, and then dispensing the powder into a generic disposable water bottle.

     Hey fellow Amazon shoppers, I recently got my hands on the Rising Warrior Small & Large 2-Pack Protein Powder Water Bottle Funnel, and I've gotta say, it's been a great addition to me.As someone who's always on the go, I needed a convenient way to carry my supplements without dealing with messy spills or lugging around bulky containers. These funnels came to the rescue.The two different funnel sizes are a lifesaver. The large one is perfect for my hefty scoops of protein powder, while the smaller one is just right for my pre-workout and BCAA's. It's like they read my mind!What's really cool is that they fit snugly onto my shakers and water bottles, so I can take them with me wherever I need to go. No more worrying about protein spills ruining my gym bag. Plus, the keychain carabiner is a nifty addition. I can easily clip it onto my bag and forget about it until I need it.Safety-wise, these funnels are BPA-free, so no need to stress about any harmful stuff leaching into my supplements. And cleaning them is a breeze – just a quick hand wash or toss them in the dishwasher, and they're good to go.In terms of value, I think they're a good deal. You get two funnels and the added convenience of the keychain attachment, all at a reasonable price.Compared to other options out there, these Rising Warrior funnels stand out. Most others don't come with two sizes or the handy keychain. It's those little things that make a big difference, you know?Now, I do have a couple of minor gripes. The smaller funnel could be a bit roomier – sometimes pouring certain supplements into it can be a bit messy. And while the pillbox storage in the large funnel is a neat idea, I wish it was more securely attached.Overall, though, I've been loving these funnels. They've made my daily routine so much easier. I no longer have to carry around multiple containers or worry about spills. I can customize my supplement intake and enjoy the convenience of having everything in one compact package.So, if you're in need of a convenient way to take your protein powder and other supplements on the go, I highly recommend giving the Rising Warrior funnels a shot. They've been a game-changer for me, and I think they'll do the same for you. Stay fit, my friends!",VINE VOICE,the United States,2023-07-11

I was so tired of having to put it in a small Tupperware or ziplock bag that spilled a bunch of it trying to get it into my water bottle. The small funnel works perfectly to hold the powder and allows me to put it in the water bottle without making a mess on the counter. My husband has enjoyed using the larger one at the gym. They are made of plastic which is fine and sturdy enough for my purposes but I took a star off for the plastic clip.

I have been using this brand for 1 month and have only tried the Belgian chocolate flavour which is always my go to flavour, and this has such a great taste but I'm braving it today and have ordered the strawberry. When I was a kid there was a dessert called angel delight which was a powder you whisked with milk and chilled in the fridge and it was a thick pudding and the taste of this shake reminds me of that. It really satisfies my sweet tooth.My advice tips to make this shake its best is start with a good shaker bottle as it makes all the difference. There are a load of shakers but after trying 4 different styles the one to to find is with a sieve thing (it's really a 1/2 centimeter square grid pattern) and it justs clicks in the top (about an inch down the open lip of the cup) I have a very 'cute 700ml black colour shaker (I don't mind it's not clear) and it has a dome lid so it has plenty of room above and below the sieve to shake (hence the 700ml size). It's so so much better than a small shaker and I won't get started on shakers with the  ball as they never fully get rid of lumps. I shake it for 90 seconds as not only does it mix it really well it helps dissolve the powder so it is never unmixed and will never leave you with a powdery aftertaste, which for me shows its a bad mixer and not because the powder won't mix properly. I know using a blender will give a great smooth texture but I am rarely near one for day to day use. This powder is also great made into a smoothy with a few berries etc and what's perfect for me is you don't have to use a banana as the smoothy base as the powder has a thickener.The chocolate flavour is so good that it covers the taste of the extra milled flaxseed I add to my shake. At the moment I use this shake mainly for breakfast so I choose to have the 350ml size and use 50% lactose free SS milk and 50% water - I love mine very cold and I drink it within about 10 minutes of it being made so it stays really cold. I think my 50/50 mix gives a great consistency, some reviews have said it's too thick and when it's measured and made perfectly it is a shake on the slightly thicker side but i don't think it's gloopy and honestly just customise it for your own tastes and let it out with more liquid but adding a bit at the time!A good tip if you make yours before the gym/workout to have ready as you finish, make it as you would normally or even slightly thicker and as you leave pop some ice cubes in (you'd have to trial how many) and they'd melt during your workout and by the time you're ready they will have melted, given you the liquid for your preferred consistency, so another few shakes just how you like it and the bonus it will be nicely chilled!I've lost count of how many powders I've tried and this Belgian chocolate really comes out on top by a long shot in flavour, consistency, price, amount of protein, vitamins and the specialised combination of nutrients. It leaves me feeling full for a good 4 hours and I'm loosing weight. Perfect! Definitely recommend.",Verified Purchase,the United Kingdom,2017-05-26

Slight issue with the delivery though being sent to the wrong address but when I finally got it I followed the instructions on the back and quickly whipped up my very first protein shake in my nutri bullet blenderI used 200ml water instead of 175ml, ONE scoop of powder but it tasted really warm so I added a handful of ice cubes and blended again. Perfect.As for flavour, let’s be honest, it doesn’t taste like a chocolate bar but it satisfies you if you have a strong sweet tooth like me and what with it being filling you wouldn’t want to eat anything else afterwards, which is great.The reason for me buying is because I’m always in a bit of a rush in the mornings and never get a chance to have a proper breakfast, only a few sips of coffee then it’s out the door straight to work. Seeing how quick it is to make this protein shake tonight and how filling it is, this is now my new breakfast!The only major con and big let down, hence why I had to go down a star is because of the packaging. It says on the front that the pack is “resealable” and to cut along the line, so I was expecting one of those grip seal bags, for me to open it and it’s velcro. Sorry, correction, chocolate powder covered velcro that won’t even seal shut. I had some pegs lying around so got 2 and sealed it myself by folding the top down. This shouldn’t have to be done though so I’m quite disappointed.Overall, the product is worth the money, your paying £17.99 (if you have prime as the delivery is free), for a big bag of protein powder, the taste is great, super filling, great as a meal replacement.",Verified Purchase,the United Kingdom,2022-01-30

None of them ever came close to the Myoplex range. Protein shake reviews rely on personal taste factors and one size does not fit all as they say.For years I have bought grass fed natural plain whey isolate powder which is healthier as - no fillers. Issue with that is its grainy texture. I have to use frozen berries or ice to thicken it and get rid of the grainy texture. This means I have to use a blender each time.I decided to try PHD diet whey, I dislike the fillers and fake sugars but I would use it occasionally when no blender available. Firstly this is the first protein powder to mix thick without blender. Best result is with a blender and some sugar free almond milk but ice water in a shaker produces a very nice drink indeed!The only negative I can think of is the slight artificial chocolate taste and it's rather sweet. This is easily fixed by mixing a scoop with a half serving of plain whey isolate powder.I like this shake, it's not perfect but much better if you want a thick filling shake.

I ended up having to use a hand blender and that did the job.

Don't get me wrong it's not a bad taste, it's just not what I expected,.I would say it does taste better with milk than water but it's up to you.

After shaking the product, it stayed a very thick slodge which didn't look right and when trying it I was so disappointed! It doesn't taste very chocolatey at all and the consistency was awful. It tasted more like raw cake mixture! So this one mix was binned. I then made a second mixture of 1 scoop and ice with 350ml of water. definitely wasn't a think slodge this time and was more a smooth shake. It still didn't taste great but the taste of raw cake mix had decreased and was drinkable. It's definitely better with ice.

I do not take all four tablespoons at one time because I did not want to bulk up one section of my stomach. I've purchased this multiple times and figured out I can fit two tablespoons in the dinky tupperware type containers to keep with me. I usually mix it in with six ounces of water, milk, or a mix of water and pineapple juice at every main meal.  It depends on what else I've eaten during the day when deciding how many tablespoons I take.It is my understand that the majority of the Hemp Pro Fiber is over 80 percent insoluble, meaning, it isn't digested rather it grabs waste to remove it more effectively from the body. That is why I take it with my meals. The lower than twenty percent portion is soluble fiber that attracts water, slows digestion, makes me feel full. I believe this amount of soluble fiber is enough to get the recommended ratio of soluble and insoluble fiber if taken as nature intended, throughout the day- and with spaced meals and adequate fluids. I do like that aspect of it very much. I've grown to like the flavor by switching up what I mix with it. I used to mix it in with smoothies until I realized it seems more beneficial to take it with meals that need to be purged quickly, like fatty foods that have high cholesterol or high saturated fat. I can not say for certain but this fiber supplement was part of my intake regiment, along with less than 18 saturated fat, walking three miles three times a week, and my cholesterol dropped 150 points-and my triglycerides dropped 400- within a month, bringing it back to normal.

I bought this, and I feel compelled to use it, but oh my heavens is it gross.  Perhaps I expected too much; my previous unsweetened/unflavored protein powders were flavorless and dissolved well.  But they were also whey, and in the midst of an ill-fated Whole30 experiment, I decided that while protein powders are technically frowned upon, they aren't technically forbidden if they're otherwise on plan, and this was literally the only no-dairy, no-legume, no-sweetener of any sort protein powder that I could afford, and I was SO VERY TIRED of endlessly dicing potatoes to eat with eggs, so I went for it.  I've ordered Manitoba Harvest hemp hearts before and those were fine--essentially flavorless, they made a passable low carb porridge.  (Yes I do diet terribly, why do you ask?)The morning after it arrived, I opened it excitedly...and ugh.  It stinks.  Like when you mow your lawn just ahead of a rainstorm and then the clippings you're trying to let decay naturally start to decompose while still damp.  Maybe if I'd spent my teenage years consuming substances that would probably get my review denied instead of reading and pining after dudes who saw me as a surrogate mother (don't ask), I'd be somehow prepared for the stink of hemp.  But, alas, I was a good kid, so I reeled.  Nevertheless, I figured anything can be concealed with enough frozen berries.  I was wrong.  It's as bitter as I have grown at the disappointments of life.  Still, I choked that sucker down and moved on from that particular terrible diet the very next day.  This morning, on probably my fourth diet plan of the year (it was also the second!), I couldn't find the scoop for my whey protein called for in the Fat Stripping Frappa recipe, and this still needs to be used, so I decided to see if it could be concealed with unsweetened chocolate almond milk, a generous serving of cacao powder, and some monkfruit sweetener.  Once again, I was wrong.  This morning's smoothie tasted of richly textured chocolatey lawn clippings.And that leads me to the other thing.  This does not blend.  At all.  I have an immersion blender that crushes ice into teeny little pieces that aren't even pieces anymore but basically frost.  What I'm saying is, it is not underpowered.  Both times, my blender handled everything BUT the hemp powder.  The first time, I tried to believe it was seeds from the frozen blackberries which were otherwise entirely pulverized.  This time, lacking seeds or anything else to blame, I had to face facts.  Mulch just does not dissolve, and this is mulch.It might be fantastic compost, though.

Don't count on it for adding omega 3 to your diet","I buy this because I have intolerances/allergies to dairy (so no whey/casein proteins), and eggs (no protein made from eggs). Soy I have to limit, so that basically leaves pea protein or hemp powders. It's great that it doesn't contain stevia, or sweetener (thank you!). I actually have a bad reaction to stevia as well and sugar makes me crash. So that part is 5 stars right there.From what I understand a problem with our diet is too much omega 6 (inflammatory) vs too little omega 3 (anti-inflammatory), they basically balance each other out. However I can't help but notice that the omega 6 for this product is over 3x the omega 3 content, so I don't think it's really going to help. Plus the omega 3 is composed of ALA which needs to be converted and you actually get less total omega 3.It looks like there's one ingredient on the bottle, but then I realized that I don't know what constitutes ""hemp powder"", they didn't say ""raw cold milled organic hemp seeds,"" now did they? So there could be some hidden ingredients/substances in there. Plus what does ""organic"" really mean anyway?I basically use this to increase the protein and fiber content of fruit smoothies so I don't pass out from all the nearly liquified sugar entering my body (even if much of it has to process through the liver first, depending on what type). It helps, but I don't use the full amount because it will overwhelm the smoothie and make it taste bad. Basically if you use half the amount (2 tablespoons) it's still drinkable and you're adding about 6.5 grams of fiber and 5.5 grams of protein, kinda negligible but better. I sometimes also add other things to help keep my blood sugar more level so I don't fall asleep after drinking a smoothie.

It has 20 g of protein per serving. For some reason, I expected it have a mild taste. Granted -this is my first time trying anything other than a dairy protein powder and I don't have anything else to compare to, but I made my first shake with the Hemp Pro 70 with 1/2 serving of it to give it a go yesterday. Well, it tasted like wild grass (what I'd imagine wild grass would taste like). Luckily a friend who already uses Hemp Powder, recommended adding cocoa powder--which really helped to mellow the grassy taste. So right now, enjoying a second shake with the Hemp Pro 70 and also upped the protein serving to 3 TBS (working my way up to a full serving of 4 TBS). Really enjoying it and the grassy taste isn't overwhelming.I have now had several shakes with the Hemp Pro 70 and I'm used to it and I love my morning shake with it!Shake with Hemp Protein Powder1 cup of unsweetened coconut milk (can use almond milk or water)2 tsp of chia seeds--let sit to gel if you wish, then add remaining ingredients1 scoop of Hemp Pro 70 Powder (or less)2 TBS of cocoa powder1.5 tsp of THM Sweet Blend (use more if using truvia, probably around 4 packets) or sweetener of choice.1 cup or so (really whatever I can fit into my single serve blender) of your FROZEN berries of choice (frozen so you don't need any ice)Blend and Enjoy",Size: 16 Ounce (Pack of 1),the United States,2015-02-08

In a frantic attempt to save my tongue, I quickly added a dash of Avocado oil and salt into my cup and threw it in the blender. WOW! I couldn't put the cup down!When I first tried a similar powder from TJ's, I was excited by the idea of using hemp as an alternative to milk/whey for protein supplementing. I was appalled, however, with the flavor and texture. It was AWFUL! How on earth could anyone drink this stuff in a smoothie!? At the time, I was using peanut butter, banana and almond milk in my smoothies and on their own (or with whey protein) they tasted great, and I was regularly excited for my morning meal.

I couldn't figure it out, so I gave up on the stuff.Now several years later, I'm on an extremely strict diet for an overactive immune system, so I've been looking into alternative food sources to both round out my palette and support my need for high nutrition. Organic meat (chicken and beef) has been my sole source of protein for the past several weeks, and whereas my grilling skills have gone through the roof as a result, I've been getting tired of eating farm animals every day. Cue the return of protein powder. I was looking into hemp seeds as a meat alternatives for protein, when I came across the idea of baking them into breads. Apparently some people have discovered ways to bake high-protein, high-fiber breads using not just the seeds, but the hemp powder derived from them (as it says on the package).This amazingly healthy food CAN be made into delicious recipes.

I like using the hemp+fiber in cold cereal,but that has a nutty flavor and it can't be done with this product(to my tastes. Plus it is powdery and I ended up inhaling some of it down my throat when I tried that,which makes you choke/anyone who ever at powdered Nestle's Quick off the spoon as a kid probably knows what I'm talking about. The way,the fastest,easiest way to get a good bit of protein is to add hemp protein to cold cereal. I decided to try grinding/chopping walnuts in my blender,mixing it with this protein-dense hemp protein,adding a little turbinado sugar and putting it in cold cereal. And it works and tastes just fine. Most likely, almonds or sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds would work just as well,(or other nut/seed  that might be preferred.) Also,using the Light Silk original flavor soymilk,which has some cane sugar in it,also works well. But I use it on Old Fashioned oatmeal. Uncooked and cold,straight from the box,and it is an unsweetened (hot) cereal which is fine,to me and a few other people I know,eaten as a cold cereal).  If someone is using a cereal that already has sweetening in it,I think modifying or altering other sugar(or the soymilk) I mentioned would be best.I like it because it delivers a substantial amount of protein in a compact serving size(protein grams per ounce or protein grams per serving is what I generally look for). I'm happy with this product. I haven't tried it in cereal yet but I might. Someone told me the hemp + fiber was good in cereal and I thought they were nuts.(Again,I already was using hemp protein + fiber but only used it in smoothies) But I tried it in some Yogi vegan cereal with unsweetened soy milk and it was very good. This is straight hemp protein without fiber and for typical use of protein powders, I like it.

I come from a life of eating minimal vegetables and animal products, processed foods and sweet foods. I've kept an active lifestyle but have kidney and an inflammatory issue that is starting to distort my fingers. After lots of reading in desperation, I felt my diet was at the very least, adding fuel to the fire. (I heard this before but never took it serious) I had to train myself to like more plant based food and bring down my dependence on the other stuff. I ran into this Hemp pro 70, and amazing meal vanilla chi drink on a great special, that I decided to give it a shot. I've since repurchased it 3 times at full price. I'm using it to help transition me while I learn to like better foods and cut out the old stuff. It sucked, I hate it so much at first but for me the alternative of doing nothing was the worst option.Anyways, I use a scoop of this, a scoop of amazing grass,  frozen raspberries and unsweetened almond milk in a ninja blender. Even then it can have a bit of a dirt like feel, but it's tolerable for me. The 5 stars are for tolerably alone. It's good on my stomach and it doesn't make me gag (which is big for me). I get more use to it as I drink it. It ALMOST find myself enjoying it after a hard day of yard work.

Yoghurt blends very well with it. For breakfast stir three tbsp Hemp Pro 70 into a cup of goat-milk yoghurt, along with walnuts, dried cranberries (or fresh blueberries when available), a tsp maca powder and a tsp raw cacao nibs. Easily keeps me satisfied till past midday.I was worried the flavor might degrade after opening the bag, as weeks go by. But it tastes just as fresh and nutty three weeks after opening as the first day, which says to me that whoever produces the stuff has a quality procedure.Another thing I like is that the grind is so fine it will blend with just about anything just using a spoon, no blender necessary. Excellent product. No other brand I've tried has been this fine-ground. Closest is Nutiva, which tastes great but is harder to blend since it's not as fine. Also Nutiva doesn't have a 70 percent protein variety.Update: In the latest batch I ordered, in 32 oz size, the 'resealable' pouch would not reseal, no matter how I tried. The ziploc function on the previous order worked normally but the new packaging - with more orange graphics - will not reclose. So I'm deducting one star from my review.Update: A year later (during which I switched to Nutiva since I found it locally), I've ordered a fresh batch of 32oz Hemp Pro 70.

This is the only protein powder that does not trash my digestive system. It's earthy, yet creamy flavor adapts to just about anything you mix it with.I'm not a nutritionist, so I'm not going to be like everyone else on the internet and write as if I am. However, it's said that hemp protein has the most ideal proportions of amino acids for the human body. Also, it's a plant protein, which is awesome because that's gotta be way healthier than getting it from mammal parts, right?ProTip: This protein contains a high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio. Since it's said (by nutritionists) that it's best to keep this balanced in favor of omega-3, I recommend you incorporate a tablespoon of flax seed oil for every scoop of this protein. This will balance out the fats and five you whatever benefits that gives you.Since this is my single top favorite product on all of amazon, I'll add my basic recipe that I alter frequently.

You must realize that compared to other hemp proteins that I have tried, this hemp protein is by far the best. In general, hemp protein is a disgusting, gritty mess. Glory be to the brave people who mix hemp protein with water and drink it. I would rather mix beach sand with water and drink that. It would taste a bit more savory. Here is why Hemp Pro 70 is superior. First, it IS slightly less gritty than other hemp proteins even from this same manufacturer. Second, when mixing this protein with other ingredients, you DO have the ability to mask the fact that hemp protein is actually in your shake! Here is what I mean. I mixed 3 tablespoons of Hemp Pro 70 with 1 cup spinach, 2 cups kale greens, 1 tsp cinnamon, a small amount of fresh ginger, 1 tbsp peanut butter and plenty of cold water and I have a super powerful healthy lunch. I think the Canadians will figure out how to make hemp protein delicious one day, but this is best of class right now. My digestion of this protein is fantastic! I can't take whey protein anymore; it does not agree with my digestive track. Hemp protein is a ""complete"" protein. It most closely resembles the animal version of protein but is every bit vegan. Hemp protein is easily digested and does not produce gas. I know this because I stay full long after eating this protein and I don't feel stuffed.

I see a lot of reviews on how it tastes, and let me make my opinion clear. This tastes just like what you'd expect protein powder to taste like. It's not bitter or strong at all. It's is not grainy either. It is powdered very finely. I was a little apprehensive to buy the larger size because of all the negative feedback it received on the two I mentioned, however I do like the plant and herbal flavors. I find them to be very refreshing in a world of packaged starches and sugars. Before this I was using a brown rice protein and it tastes about the same in strength of flavor. I made a smoothie out of it with fruit, coconut milk, and I had no problems with the consistency or dissolution and I could barely taste the protein powder which I used the full 4 tablespoons in. I guess if you mix it with only water it might taste bad but if you do that with most protein powders without additional flavoring I guess you could say the same. Look nothing is going to taste like cupcakes and snickerdoodles unless you eat cupcakes and snickerdoodles. Stop trying to make everything taste like a cheeseburger and ice cream.

It's a lot easier on my stomach than whey and I think the plant-based nutrition has actually helped with my weight-loss goals (but that may just be because there is less sugar and I normally just eat an apple, instead of my breakfast cereal, after taking the hemp since it's so filling).Regardless, I recommend this product!!",Size: 2 Pound (Pack of 1),the United States,2015-02-09

I'm a vegan who exercises like crazy, and I was having difficulty getting enough protein into my diet. Since January, I've tried several plant-based protein powders, and while I did find one I liked (Vega One French Vanilla), it was $25 for a 10-serving jar. I could literally feel my wallet seize up as I opened it to get out my credit card. Plus, I was a little concerned about Vega One's use of ""natural"" flavorings and artificial sweeteners. Hemp Pro 70 is much more wallet-friendly and has no added ingredients --  just 100% hemp powder. I put a serving into my green smoothie every morning, and it's a pretty tasty way to boost my protein intake. It has an earthy and mildly sweet flavor that's relatively benign (in my opinion). I use an immersion blender, and the powder does tend to clump up when I'm mixing my smoothie, but I just blend it more than I normally would, and that solves the problem.

No bloated or groggy feelings at all.  I can even start the day with a hemp shake and feel great afterwards, but I can't say that for whey shakes.  This particular powder is much finer than the normal or chocolate flavors, but it's just as good, if not better.  I really don't mind if it clumps up because it actually tastes natural to me.  I like to stir it in a little water before adding the blended banana/almond milk, but do what works for you.If you're on the fence, just try it.

My starting weight is 185 and I am 5'5"" tall. The goal is to lose 40 pounds. After getting the approval from my doctor, I bought the energy Mocha Cappuccino Slimfast shakes for energy in the morning and I bought regular Slimfast shakes to drink midday. It states on the bottle that in order to lose weight, you can have one meal a day (having at least 1,200 calories a day in total), replace two meals with either shakes smoothies or bars, and you can have up to three snacks. I find this pretty sensible.The shake itself is delicious. There is no chalky taste, either. The cappuccino taste isn't too strong but it's still good. The consistency is thin, not thick like a shake normally would be but this doesn't bother me. I'd say it works so far. I woke up after having a rough nights sleep and this shake gave me the energy boost I needed to start the day and I'm also full as well. We'll see how long the full feeling lasts.If you are trying to lose weight this way, go in to it with the right expectations. I don't think the shake alone is meant to keep you full for hours. It does HELP to keep you full, but you still have to have snacks in between and a decent meal.Will update the review in the future to give results. Good luck to anyone else trying to lose weight!

The Caramel Latte was my favorite - a thick, rich caramel flavor. The Caramel Macchiato is much thinner, much more coffee tasting, much more bitter. Coffee definitely outweighs the caramel, where it was the opposite with the Caramel Latte. I'm so disappointed in it, that I opt for the chocolate, which is rare - I typically prefer caramel over chocolate. I really don't care for strong, cold coffee, as it tastes more bitter to me than hot coffee. I was hoping it was temporary because I was ordering several 12 packs in my subscribe and save monthly delivery. I don't taste the overwhelming cold coffee taste in the chocolate flavor, and I prefer its thicker consistency. Maybe it tricks my brain, but it feels more filling than the new caramel drink, the same way it did with the old, thicker caramel latte.That all said, I buy these because I love the ingredients - 20g of protein, decent amount of caffeine, 5g of fiber (more filling), some fat and low carb.I used to be a major buyer/fan of Bang Keto Coffee, but they discontinued it in their bankruptcy to streamline and remain in business. Slim Fast has been the closest alternative that I found with the added benefit of vitamins and fiber (just much less caffeine - darn).

I started with the vanilla thinking this would be the easiest flavor to incorporate into my routine which consists of a veggie/fruit smoothie for breakfast and sometimes a pre or post workout smoothie. I am not a big fan of the vanilla in my breakfast smoothie, but it's not too bad in the one I make with bananas and/or sweet potatoes, almond milk, and peanut butter powder. I think the vanilla leaves a bit of a noticeable after taste and seems to sweet in an artificial way (I can't think of a better way to describe it). That being said, I really like the chocolate in the aforementioned smoothie. It complements the peanut butter powder really well and I don't have the after taste issue I have with the vanilla. I was somewhat surprised to find that I love the berry flavored powder. Now I miss it when I make a smoothie without it. I think it helps smooth out the texture a bit (I mix my breakfast fruit/veggie smoothie with non-sweet green tea that I brew). I ran out and used some of the Vega Protein & Greens berry flavored powder (which was available at Target when I ran out while out of town). I definitely prefer the Vega Sport. I do always cut my portions in half so it's nice that the big container comes with a scoop that measures out a half portion. Adding some protein to my breakfast smoothie has helped me not be hungry before lunch. I'm a terrible morning eater, I'm just not usually hungry first thing, so having a liquid breakfast is very convenient.I'm also not an athlete per se. I chose the Vega Sport over some of the other Vega options because I have arthritis in my hip and the Vega Sport contains a number of ingredients that help with inflammation (turmeric and tart cherry are two of these) and the lack of animal proteins is beneficial too since I'm just not ready to go full vegetarian in my daily life but I am trying to limit things that can trigger my inflammation when I can. As part of my anti-inflammation eating, exercising, and weight maintenance program, Vega Sport has really been helping me. It tastes good and seems to work. I haven't been using the Vega Sport as much as a post-workout protein option as it is probably intended, but I do still think I'm getting some performance benefits from it (I use some other Vega Sport products as well).",Flavor Name: Berry,the United States,2016-05-11

But the Buried Scoop is Driving me Crazy!!,"The Good: I've now bought two flavors, the Chocolate and the Berry, and they are both outstandingly delicious. I literally put the Chocolate protein powder on my chocolate goodies to make them taste even better. Ice cream, brownies, muffins, whatever, dust this on top like it's powdered sugar and it really makes everything pop. And the Berry tastes straight up like a (slightly grainy) smoothie.I am such a fan of the flavors, alone, that I'm probably a fan for life, let alone the fact that they don't use sucralose which has kept me from losing weight for way longer than I'd like to admit. So much for all those ""weight loss"" protein powders, using an ingredient that literally causes obesity. :Not Mad: (sarcasm) I've lost 10 lbs in my first month just from switching to this product from other brands. No other changes.The Neutral: In my opinion, both of these flavors pretty much need to be chilled to taste their best, which is something I've never felt necessary before.The Bad: Grainy, very staticky as is the norm for pea proteins, apparently, and the Berry one foams excessively and never settles back down.The Worst: With all three tubs that I've bought so far the scoop is all the way at the very bottom of the container. For the first one I had to reuse a scoop from a different protein powder until I finally got to the one that was given and from there I've been reusing each scoop for the next one in a continuous cycle of not getting to the scoop until I'm at least half way into the container and can safely turn the thing around to dig it out.It's not actually the worst scenario but it's the worst part about this product. I've never had to deal with this before, even buying 5lb tubs through Amazon. It's as if they're purposefully throwing the scoop in first and burying it.At this point I wish they'd use that glue that companies use to mail you cards onto the bottom of the scoop and stick it to the underside of the paper seal. This would be so amazing, no more digging for the scoop, which is even more of a hassle when the powder is so staticky.",Flavor Name: Berry,the United States,2023-06-13

Cheaper then Walmart and I can realize I am running out and order, knowing I will have a fresh supply the following day.I was skeptical when I first started- I was prepared to resent my choice of the slimfast 1 2 3 diet.  I can honestly say I am pleasantly surprised.  I bought this and a different caffeinated meal replacement shake brand with my first order- and can say this is cheaper per drink, comes pre-mixed and is so much better.  This is convenient, easy to grab and go.I am an overnight worker.  I decided to try meal replacement shakes due to always wanting to snack.  I would easily drink 4 rockstar's (sugar free), a 5hr energy shot and a regular red bull every shift.  On top of that, I wanted to snack on candy all night, as well as eat a bag of popcorn.One of these as I arrive on shift, 2 servings of raw broccoli, carrots and cauliflower or a romaine salad between 12am-1am, and another shake around 4am keeps me satisfied and awake all night.  I get home, and I drink a high protein without caffeine drink, complete barn chores and nap.  I eat a vegetable and meat based dinner, and have been feeling better, more alive- and best of all a sense of freedom from caffeine!  I easily drink 7 16.5oz waters daily now and within 3 days did not have the caffeine headaches and sugar cravings.Once I get back to my desired weight, I plan on continuing purchasing this for my overnight shifts, and continuing to eat sensibly.Aside from the positive impact this is having on my health- I am grateful to not be spending $15+ on beverages alone just for a work shift.  These bottles average $1 each, and my cases of 40ct waters sell for $4-5ish.  I spend roughly $4 a day in drinks as opposed to $20- huge savings and so much healthier.I love the taste of these when they are nice and cold- honestly I have not dared trying it room temperature.Thank you Amazon for making it possible to maintain a healthy lifestyle without having to go to a bigger town, and making it affordable.",Style: Chocolate Energy,the United States,2019-11-26

I quit looking for other ones after I found this one (Choc Peanut Butter). It's the best. It blends very well, doesn't have a gritty flavor, has tons of good ingredients I'd be unlikely to consume otherwise, and it tastes good.What I especially appreciate about THIS particular Choc PB flavor from Amazing Grass is that it doesn't have that super sweet stevia flavor that a lot of the powders have. I've used less natural protein powders in the past and they may taste more 'normally' sweet but they have chemicals in them that I don't want to consume.In the category of naturally sweetened powders, even the other Amazing Grass flavors have that super-stevia flavor, which personally I don't care for. I've accidentally purchased the plain Chocolate flavor of Amazing Grass more than once. The only way I can manage to drink it is to blend some PB2 peanut butter powder in it and mask that flavor a bit. I tried the Choc Mint flavor once during the winter and it was not tolerable due to the uber-stevia flavor. So I just keep returnint to buy this Choc PB flavor and double checking that I'm not buying plain Chocolate! lolI blend my powder with several things that I want to consume and it's easiest to toss in here:  Matcha green tea powder, a packet of Knox gelatin (works better than any collagen powder I've tried and is way cheaper), sometimes a bit of charcoal powder, Epicor powder, almond milk, and a few drops of Vanilla Sweet Drops to help offset any bitter flavor that may result from the supplements I've tossed in.Does it taste like a delicious milkshake?  No.  Is it healthier and keeps me full into the early afternoon? Yes. It's a great way to take in a lot of protein and other good nutrients without a lot of calories.

This one actually tastes ok and I actually find myself wanting to drink it.  I think because it makes me feel good.The taste is ok.

It did have a bit of a gritty feel to it, but I haven't tried any that don't have some grittiness, and this one is far from the worst, and among the best.The powder is greenish and smells a bit grassy, not surprising given the ingredients.  After trying it plain, I've been using it in my normal smoothies, and it makes a very nice addition, and with a good shot of protein in it.  I do admit that I use less than a full serving in my smoothies because I don't think I need the full serving considering the other things I throw in.  I still get a decent amount of protein, and the container lasts longer.  Protein powders can be pricey, no matter which one you choose.I like the plant-based ingredients and I really like that they are organic.

I'd bought a canister while at the store, liked it, and decided to buy more on Amazon because the price (at this time) is better.My opinion on this protein powder would be drastically different if the main reason I was drinking it was for taste and to have a drink to ""fill me up.""  But, just like with the green superfood powders, I use this because it's good for me and makes me feel good when I use it.  So ""taste"" is WAY down on my list of importance with products of this sort.This isn't one of those bulking-up type protein powders that bodybuilders use.  Instead, it's just a nice protein boost made up of plant-based proteins (organic pea, quinoa, hemp, and chia) along with a bit of greens added to equal 2 servings of fruit/vegetables.  I use it to make a smoothie as soon as I get home from a hard workout at the gym since it's important to take in protein within an hour or so after strenuous workouts.  My smoothies aren't exciting with lots of added ingredients since I'm also trying to keep the calorie count down.  I just use ice, some organic unsweetened almond milk, and a scoop of this protein powder.  It's not delicious, but tastes good enough to be easily drinkable.I regularly eat lots of vegetables and fruit, but I like that this protein mix contains a good bit of green-food complex along with the protein.  However, I thought I'd point out that if you like a purely vanilla-tasting experience in your protein drinks or smoothies, this may surprise you when you see that your resulting smoothie is a pale green rather than the creamy white vanilla appearance (and taste) you were maybe expecting.  Dry, the powder is mostly a creamy white color, but the green starts showing up when it gets wet.One serving (1 scoop) offers 20 grams of complete protein, 4 grams of carbs, and less than 1 gram of sugar.

The flavor of this shake is ok. I prefer the “original” flavor best over chocolate or vanilla, and found that it’s pretty easy to take down if I put ice in it. I don’t add this to my smoothies as I feel it makes them too thick. Instead I just pound a scoop of this mixed with water and ice when I wake up.

I found Amazing grass while researching the best Vegan Protein Powders to try after deciding Shakeology was too expensive and lacking in the amount of protein and if we're honest, flavor. The peanut butter chocolate was the first flavor I tried. I was pretty impressed with it at first, all though it doesn't taste much like chocolate at all and mostly peanut butter. I then ordered their Vanilla and Chocolate to try. The vanilla was pretty good, although it tasted nothing like vanilla, but maybe more of a chai tea or something? It tasted like cinnamon or some sort of spice. I can't put my finger on it. The chocolate was probably my favorite, which is strange because that's the one that you can taste the stevia in the most. If you hate stevia, stay away from the chocolate.What attracted me to Amazing Grass was the full serving of fruit and veggies, greens, no flax seed (I have a family member who is intolerant) and the 20 grams of protein. What turned me off, besides getting extremely tired of the flavors before I'm even half-way through the tub, was the fact that I didn't need an additional serving of fruit (I basically eat fruit all day long) and 20% of vitamin A isn't a lot, but my vitamins have like 50% plus the amount I'm eating in other foods I don't know about and so if I want 1 serving in the morning and 1 at night I'm riding a dangerous line (p.s. I'm preggers, hence the worry of vitamin A over-dosage).Over all, it wasn't bad. I'd still recommend it to people who aren't getting enough fruit and veggies in their diet, or can't digest flax seed, but for myself, I'll be switching to a new brand.",Verified Purchase,the United States,2018-04-13

I thought it was fabulous but too expensive to buy for use on a daily basis @ $30 for a 10-day supply.  So I'm experimenting with trying to recreate that product as best I can on a cheaper scale.  I was drawn to this powder because it contained nearly the same blend of plant-based protein I was looking for, along with a number of superfoods I had also wanted to see included.  The two ingredients I had been looking for that were missing were Maca root and Moringa leaf.  So I purchased separate packages of those powders, along with this Amazing Grass Protein Superfood Powder in the Rich Chocolate flavor.  The protein powder from my gym that I am used to contained some cacao but absolutely no sweetener.  I would mix that powder in with 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk, 1 banana, and 1/2 cup of frozen mixed berries.  So my sweetness would come from the banana primarily.  However, I noted that the Amazing Grass blend listed a sweetener (Stevia) as one of its ingredients.  I would have preferred an unsweetened/unflavored variety, but unfortunately the unfavored option only came in a smaller, 12 oz size.  I really wanted the largest size, both for economics reasons and so that I wouldn't have to repurchase the product so quickly.  The only variety that came in the larger 22.9 oz size was the chocolate flavor, so I decided to give it a try.I made my first shake today using the Amazing Grass powder and my other two supplements and the same recipe I've always used with the banana, etc.  My first taste I was hit with the sweetness of the shake.  It tasted so incredibly sweet to me as to make it almost unpleasant.  I'm just not used to that level of sweetness in a protein shake.  However, I experimented with adding about a 1/2 cup of water and when I tasted it again, it was significantly better and much more drinkable, along with being less thick.  So that will be my recipe going forward.  When I run out of the chocolate (in 17 days), I am going to buy the original unsweetened/unflavored variety in the smaller size just to compare the taste and sweetness level, and then decide after that which variety I prefer.For people who eat a lot of sweet things or processed foods, you may love the sweetness level of the chocolate powder and think I'm crazy for complaining that it is too sweet.  But for people like me who generally eat very clean and avoid sugars and sweets for the most part, and/or those who are used to unsweetened/unflavored protein mixes, I believe you would find this flavor to be a bit too sweet without watering it down somewhat.",Flavor Name: Rich Chocolate,the United States,2019-03-21

With this strawberry though, when you just mix with water, it doesn't taste very good. I've either had to mix some frozen strawberries in it, put a shot of OJ in it...something to improve the flavor. I don't feel like hassling with that in the morning (this is my breakfast), so I just prefer the chocolate.

The second I tasted the chocolate and strawberry flavored powders, I knew I was in for 40 shakes of hard work. Hard work to get it down that is. The flavor is severely chalky with a strong mix of chemical aftertaste. There are simply too many great tasting products out there today that go down easier than to recommend this product on taste.

That said, the double stuff and fuzzy naval jars I got are sitting hardly touched as the flavor I keep returning to is Cappuccino.

The Cappuccino tastes a lot like a slightly thickened decaf coffee drink with a lot of cream and sweetener.

Mixed perfectly together not too sweet either and on plus side less calories when mixed with water.There are bits in the shake but it's just one of the ingredients for me it doesn't effect the drink. I have a shake for breakfast and lunch and then eat a healthy meal for tea. I find the shakes filling and they do keep hunger at bay.I do find myself thirsty with this product which is a known side affect looking at other websites however drinking plenty of water as you should anyway solves this.All in all I would certainly recommend the product, don't just go by reviews on here though.

So.. in my humble opinion (which may very well be incorrect).Banana: 10/10 - Tastes like a McD's milkshake, my absolute favouriteBelgian Choc: 9/10 - Feels like you're having desert, not a protein shakeChoc Peanut: 6/10 - Odd aftertaste but nice if you drink as many of these as I do and want to mix it upStrawberry: 8/10 - Can't go wrong with strawberryBakewell Tart : 3/10 - I wanted to like it. I couldn't. Too artificial.As with all of these WASH the container out as soon as you get home / are done. Whey protein is essentially a petri dish for bacteria and if you open a bottle of made-up shake after 24h you'll have a very, very unpleasant surprise and the most disgusting thing you've ever smelt in your life.Also, it helps to use these with a quick blender to get the consistency right. Hope this helps!",Verified Purchase,the United Kingdom,2016-02-07

It helps me feel full and nourished, which is essential for avoiding snacking and staying on track with my weight loss goals.Given the sensitivity of my digestive system post-surgery, I appreciate that this protein powder is gentle on my stomach. It’s also lactose-free, which is a huge plus for those of us with lactose intolerance.This powder isn't just for drinks; I've also used it in various recipes like yogurt or smoothies, which helps keep my diet varied and interesting.Incorporating this protein powder into my daily routine has made a significant difference in reaching my protein goals, maintaining muscle mass, and overall recovery post-bariatric surgery.I highly recommend Isopure’s Watermelon Lime protein powder to any bariatric patient or anyone looking for a high-quality, delicious protein supplement.

I used to regularly drink Ascent Protein Water until it was discontinued.  It wasn't until then that I realized how hard it was to find a clear protein that tasted good and was not sweetened with sucralose or aspartame.  Then I found Isopure and I was happy to see that it was sweetened with stevia so I decided to give it a try and now I am hooked.  Both flavors are delicious thought I prefer the mixed berry simply because the tropical punch is a little tart for my taste.  To curb the tartness I would simply mix with zero sugar juice instead of water and it was perfect!  Neither taste artificial and the protein does not coat your mouth like some other clear proteins do.  I usually always have a glass after my evening workouts to help with recovery and it is a super easy way to incorporate 20 grams of protein if you find yourself falling short for the day.  Give this a try, you won't be disappointed!  Isopure, I hope you come out with more flavors soon!!",Flavor Name: Mixed Berry,the United States,2023-11-30

Turns out they do absolutely nothing and it was actually affecting my liver. So I just stopped doing it but I was complaining vigorously to one of the staff at the gym and he asked if I was taking protein after my workouts. I had completely forgotten, I'm very sick of chocolate shakes or any variety of disgusting shake so I went on Amazon and found this. It tastes like ground up chalk... Where there's still some chunks that don't actually dissolve. And the flavor is similar to cherry Kool-Aid mixed in a 55 gallon drum. It's so unbelievably, tasteless and chalky but it works. I don't drink it because I like it, I drink it because I'm less sore the next day and especially a couple days later. I've only recently been using this stuff, so I can say with certainty that it's been helping me. If you give it a shot, I hope you have the same experience. But if you don't, it's Amazon...

The flavor options available are enjoyable and make it easy to incorporate into your post-workout routine. It's a great way to satisfy your craving for something other than plain water without consuming unnecessary sugars or calories.However, one area where this protein powder falls short is in its mixing ability. Some users have reported that the powder tends to clump or form power cakes, making it difficult to dissolve completely in water. This can be frustrating, especially when you're looking for a quick and easy way to prepare your post-workout drink.Considering the price point of the Isopure Protein Powder, some customers may find it a bit expensive, especially given the issue with its mixing properties.

Out of these three, its probably the best, but I was actually looking forward to my next drink/something much milder, while drinking the rest of it..Fruit Punch:I'm not sure why many people like it so much.. It has a very sharp taste to it, yet still very watery in flavor (I even tried with less water per serving..) I don't know how you'd associate it with ""fruit punch"" but idk, its not the worst flavor in the world.. Certainly not the best either..So many reviews complain about the clear whey as if they expect it to be like a normal watery beverage.. I think it's barely noticeable until you are finished of course and your lips are sticking together a bit. But for 20g's of protein in such a small serving/beverage that ISN'T A CHALKY, THICK, MILKY PROTEIN POWDER, I'll gladly take it!!Yes, it Foams up a lot when you shake it..

It’s like a bag of chips having so much air left in them you kind of feel like you could’ve gotten more per container.

The protein powder and water can be tough to drink every day, so I was thrilled when I found the fruity flavors.  Had to give them a try.  Here's the result:Best: Pre-Made Protein Waters in Your FridgeFor some reason, these flavors take forever to dissolve in water.  However, the fruity powders are fantastic for pre-made protein waters.  My recommendation is to fill a water bottle with 16-20 ounces (a full scoop will dissolve in 8-10 ounces - but the taste is very tart) of room temperature water (mixes faster than cold water).  Add a full scoop of the fruity powder and shake vigorously.  You'll end up with lots of foam and powder residue at the top of the bottle.  Pop the water bottle in the fridge for 4+ hours.  That's about how long it takes to fully dissolve and the flavor is better when cold.  The result is a fantastic fruity protein water.I like to make 4 bottles at a time and stock the fridge.  Then, I can grab one to take to a workout or in the car on the way to work. The pre-made protein waters are really good and you get the benefit of lots of water and the 20 grams of protein.  See the picture for a drink left in the fridge for 4 hours.  The powder completely dissolves and the flavor is perfect.  I've started to crave the flavor on days I don't workout.Okay: In a ShakeThe classic vanilla/choc/plain flavors dissolve easily in a small amount of water or milk. In shakes, I typically use 1/2 cup to 1 cup of liquid, which is fine for the classic flavors.  For the fruity flavors, it's hard to get them to dissolve fully in a shake.  The flavors are good - especially in berry shakes with greens - but there is always some powder residue in the shake.  You can also premix the powder and liquid and leave overnight for use in the morning for a better shake.  Makes drinking spinach or kale in a smoothie much tastier.Not Great:  Drinking Straight in a Glass of WaterSeriously, this stuff takes a LONG time to dissolve.  The fruity powders are not meant for a quick mix in a glass of water.  Stick to the classic flavors if this is your plan.",Flavor Name: Mixed Berry,the United States,2019-04-26

I did...because I am always on the go and need to mix a shake... I thought this would be perfect.CONS:The top is where the batteries go but that also unscrews the same way the top does to remove the top. So often when I go to unscrew the top the battery top comes off.  It doesn't make sense. It should have a better system.  So every time I unscrew it I risk losing the batteries too.The mixing power is sub par at best. I mixed 8 oz of water with 1 portion of a 2 scoop protein.  It barely whipped it around to mix it enough to not have lumps. It worked but it wasn't fabulous.To stop it off the actual mixing piece that extends into the bottle is flimsy and broke with in 3 mixes.Not dishwasher safe topPROS:Easy 1 button designLeak proofFood grade material and BPA freeEasy to fillEasy to clean with soap and waterOverall I found it wasn't for me based on the battery turning issue and the mixer breaking.Sorry!,VINE VOICE,the United States,2021-08-11
